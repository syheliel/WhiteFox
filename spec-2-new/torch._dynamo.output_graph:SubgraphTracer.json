    "summary": "\nThe SubgraphTracer class handles FX graph construction during PyTorch tracing. Key vulnerabilities include:\n1. Proxy object management in input_name_to_proxy could allow unauthorized graph modifications\n2. Example value extraction lacks proper validation, risking precision loss\n3. Graph argument consistency checks are insufficient, potentially allowing invalid graph operations\n",

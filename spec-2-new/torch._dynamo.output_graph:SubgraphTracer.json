    "summary": "\nThe SubgraphTracer class handles FX graph construction during PyTorch tracing. The vulnerable lines involve:\n1. Proxy object management in input_name_to_proxy dictionary which could lead to security issues if not properly validated\n2. Precision loss when extracting example values from node metadata\n3. Insufficient validation of graph argument consistency during node creation\n```\n\n```python\nclass VulnerableModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 10)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # This could trigger proxy management issues\n        x = self.linear(x)\n        \n        # This could trigger example value extraction\n        if isinstance(x, torch.Tensor):\n            size = x.size()\n            \n        # This could trigger graph validation issues\n        try:\n            x = x * 2\n        except:\n            pass\n            \n        return x\n",

When enabled, this can lead to precision inconsistencies because:\n1. Fake tensors are meant for shape/device propagation only\n2. Real tensor computations may differ from fake tensor assumptions\n3. Mixing real and fake computations can cause silent precision errors\n4. The flag is primarily for debugging but could accidentally be left enabled\n",

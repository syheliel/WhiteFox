    "summary": "\nThe cudagraphs_inner function implements CUDA graph recording and replay for PyTorch models. The vulnerable lines handle input/output copying during CUDA graph execution. Key issues:\n1. The static_inputs creation with zeros_like may cause unnecessary memory allocation\n2. The direct copy operations (copy_) may not properly handle all tensor types/precision\n3. These operations are performance-critical as they run in the CUDA graph hot path\n4. The copying behavior is controlled by copy_inputs/copy_outputs flags\n```\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nmodel = nn.Linear(10, 10).cuda()\ninputs = [torch.randn(10, 10).cuda()]\n\n# This will trigger both vulnerable lines:\n# 1. zeros_like in static_inputs creation\n# 2. copy_ operations during execution\ncompiled = torch.compile(model, backend=\"cudagraphs\")\noutput = compiled(*inputs)\n```\n\n```yaml\n- nn.Linear\n- torch.compile\n- torch.zeros_like\n- Tensor.copy_\n",

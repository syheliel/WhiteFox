The vulnerable line handles all exceptions uniformly, which can:\n1. Mask specific error types that would be useful for debugging\n2. Make it harder to diagnose root causes of failures\n3. Potentially hide important error details by converting them to a generic TorchDynamoException\n4. Lose original exception context that could be valuable for troubleshooting\n",

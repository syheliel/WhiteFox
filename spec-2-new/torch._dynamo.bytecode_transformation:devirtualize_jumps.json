    "summary": "\nThe devirtualize_jumps function handles converting virtualized jump targets back to concrete bytecode offsets in PyTorch's bytecode transformation utilities. The vulnerable line checks if an instruction is a jump operation before processing it. This is important because:\n1. Jump instructions require special handling of their target offsets\n2. The function needs to distinguish between absolute and relative jumps\n3. Python version differences affect jump instruction handling\n4. Incorrect jump target resolution could lead to malformed bytecode\n",

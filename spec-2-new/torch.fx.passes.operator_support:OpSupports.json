The vulnerable line directly checks node.name against disallow_set without any input validation, which could lead to issues if:\n1. disallow_set contains invalid node names\n2. node.name is not properly sanitized\n3. disallow_set is not a proper set type\n4. The comparison is case-sensitive when it shouldn't be\n```\n\n```python\nclass VulnerableModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 10)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.linear(x)\n        # This could trigger the vulnerable check if the node name matches\n        # any in the disallow_set without proper validation\n        x = torch.relu(x)\n        return x\n",

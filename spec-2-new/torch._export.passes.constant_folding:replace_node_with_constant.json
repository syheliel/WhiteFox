    "summary": "\nThe replace_node_with_constant function is used to replace FX graph nodes with constant values during graph optimization. The vulnerable line registers these constants as buffers without proper validation, which could lead to:\n1. Arbitrary attribute injection into the GraphModule\n2. Potential namespace conflicts with existing attributes\n3. Security risks if untrusted constants are registered\n4. Bypass of normal PyTorch parameter/buffer registration checks\n```\n\n```python\nclass VulnerableModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 10)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # This will trigger constant folding optimization\n        # The constant tensor will be registered as a buffer\n        # without proper validation\n        x = self.linear(x)\n        y = x * torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])  # This tensor will be folded\n        return y\n",

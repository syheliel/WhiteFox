    "summary": "\nThe aot_function implements a caching mechanism that stores compiled results to avoid recompilation. The vulnerable line checks if cached results exist before recompiling. This can lead to issues because:\n1. The cache is not invalidated when input shapes/types change\n2. Subsequent calls with different inputs may incorrectly reuse cached results\n3. No validation is done to ensure cached results match current inputs\n4. Missing cache invalidation could lead to incorrect computations\n",

    "summary": "\nThe `_dlclose` function in the `DLLWrapper` class is responsible for unloading a dynamic library (DLL) in Linux/Windows environments. The vulnerable line calls `f_dlclose` on the DLL handle without checking the return value or handling potential failures. This could lead to:\n1. Resource leaks if the dlclose operation fails\n2. Potential undefined behavior if the library remains loaded\n3. No error propagation if unloading fails\n4. Missing cleanup of library resources\n```\n\n```python\nclass ModelWithDLL(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        # This would typically be initialized with a real DLL path\n        self.dll_wrapper = DLLWrapper(\"path/to/library.so\")\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Use the DLL in forward pass\n        result = x * 2\n        # The DLL wrapper's destructor will be called when model is destroyed,\n        # potentially triggering the vulnerable dlclose\n        return result\n",

    "summary": "\nThe repro_tolerance configuration controls the numerical tolerance threshold used when testing for accuracy failures in compiled graphs. The fixed value of 1e-3 may be problematic because:\n1. Different models and operations have varying precision requirements\n2. Some operations (like softmax) may need tighter tolerances\n3. The same tolerance is applied globally regardless of operation type\n4. Too loose tolerance could mask real numerical issues\n```\n\n```python\nclass PrecisionSensitiveModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.softmax = nn.Softmax(dim=1)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Softmax outputs need tighter tolerance than default 1e-3\n        x = self.softmax(x)\n        # This operation would pass with default tolerance but may need smaller\n        x = x * 1e-4  \n        return x\n",

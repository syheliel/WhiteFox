    "summary": "\nThe recover_original_precision_folded_computation_ops function handles precision recovery after binary folding operations in PyTorch graphs. The vulnerable line converts folded computation results back to their original data type, which may lead to precision loss because:\n1. Binary folding operations are performed in higher precision (float32)\n2. Conversion back to original dtype (float16/bfloat16) may lose precision\n3. The conversion happens after mathematical operations where precision matters\n4. No rounding or proper handling is done during the conversion\n",

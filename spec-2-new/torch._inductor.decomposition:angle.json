The vulnerable line creates a scalar tensor for pi with potentially limited precision, which could affect:\n1. Accuracy of angle calculations for complex numbers\n2. Correct determination of pi for negative real numbers\n3. Numerical stability in downstream computations\n4. Consistency with higher precision math library operations\n```\n\n```python\nclass AngleModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 10)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Create complex tensor\n        real_part = self.linear(x)\n        imag_part = torch.rand_like(real_part)\n        complex_tensor = torch.complex(real_part, imag_part)\n        \n        # Compute angle which will use the pi constant\n        angles = torch.angle(complex_tensor)\n        \n        # Also test with real numbers\n        real_angles = torch.angle(real_part)\n        \n        return angles + real_angles\n",

    "summary": "\nThe fuse function combines convolution/linear and batch normalization layers for inference optimization. The vulnerable lines handle the fusion process which can lead to precision loss because:\n1. Fusing changes the mathematical operations performed\n2. The fused implementation may use different numerical precision\n3. Batch norm statistics are folded into weights which can amplify rounding errors\n4. The fusion assumes inference mode where training-specific behaviors don't matter\n",

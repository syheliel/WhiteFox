    "summary": "\nThe CompiledTritonKernels class manages an in-memory cache for compiled Triton kernels in PyTorch. The vulnerable functions are:\n1. key(): Generates cache keys from kernel source code without input validation\n2. save(): Stores compiled kernels in cache without size management\nKey issues:\n1. No validation of kernel_src input could lead to cache key collisions\n2. Unbounded cache growth could cause memory exhaustion\n3. No cache eviction policy implemented\n4. Potential for cache poisoning attacks\n",

    "summary": "\nThe relu_compile_error_TESTING_ONLY function is a testing-only backend that intentionally raises a ReluCompileError when encountering torch.relu operations in the graph. This is used for:\n1. Testing error handling and recovery mechanisms in TorchDynamo\n2. Simulating compilation failures during development\n3. Validating the debugging infrastructure\n4. Ensuring proper error propagation in the compilation pipeline\n",

    "summary": "\nThe OutputGraph class handles graph construction and compilation in PyTorch's Dynamo system. Key functionality includes:\n1. Managing FX graph construction through SubgraphTracer\n2. Handling graph compilation and execution\n3. Supporting features like graph deduplication and symbolic shapes\n4. Tracking side effects and managing guards\n5. Supporting higher-order operators through nested tracers\n",

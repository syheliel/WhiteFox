The vulnerable lines assert that the underlying node exists before accessing it. This is important because:\n1. These methods are called during dependency analysis and scheduling\n2. They need valid node information to return correct aliasing/mutation data\n3. Missing validation could lead to null pointer dereference if node is not set\n4. The assertions ensure the scheduler operates on valid buffer nodes\n",

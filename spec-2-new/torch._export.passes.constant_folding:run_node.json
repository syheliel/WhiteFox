    "summary": "\nThe run_node function in ConstantFolder processes nodes in a PyTorch FX graph during constant folding. The vulnerable line checks if any input matches an unknown_value marker by comparing both types and values. This comparison could fail for certain input types because:\n1. Type comparison may not work correctly for all Python types\n2. Some types may not support equality comparison\n3. The check assumes all input types can be safely compared\n4. Missing proper type handling could lead to incorrect folding decisions\n```\n\n```python\nclass CustomModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(3, 3))\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Create a tensor with custom dtype that might cause type comparison issues\n        y = x.to(torch.bfloat16)\n        z = y @ self.weight\n        # Add operation that could trigger the type comparison\n        out = z + 0.5\n        return out\n",

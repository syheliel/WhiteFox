    "summary": "\nThe `run_node` function in ConstantFolder handles node execution during constant folding in PyTorch's FX graph transformations. The vulnerable line performs type and value comparison to check for unknown values in flattened inputs. The issue is:\n1. The type comparison may fail for certain input types\n2. This could lead to incorrect constant folding decisions\n3. The comparison is used to determine if a node should be treated as an unknown value\n4. Type comparison failures could cause incorrect graph transformations\n",

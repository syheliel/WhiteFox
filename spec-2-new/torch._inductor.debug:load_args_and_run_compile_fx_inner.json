    "summary": "\nThe load_args_and_run_compile_fx_inner function is used to load serialized arguments and run the compile_fx_inner function. The vulnerable line performs unsafe pickle deserialization which can lead to arbitrary code execution. This is dangerous because:\n1. Pickle can execute arbitrary code during deserialization\n2. The function loads from an arbitrary file path\n3. There's no validation of the pickle data\n4. This could be exploited if an attacker can control the input file\n",

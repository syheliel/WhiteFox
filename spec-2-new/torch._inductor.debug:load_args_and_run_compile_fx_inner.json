    "summary": "\nThe load_args_and_run_compile_fx_inner function deserializes pickled arguments from a file path and uses them to run compile_fx_inner. The vulnerable line directly loads and deserializes pickle data without validation, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if the pickle file is maliciously crafted. This is dangerous because:\n1. Pickle can execute arbitrary code during deserialization\n2. There's no verification of the pickle file's source or integrity\n3. The function is meant for debugging but could be misused\n4. No sandboxing is applied to the deserialization process\n```\n\n```python\nclass TestModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 10)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # This would normally be part of a larger model\n        x = self.linear(x)\n        \n        # Simulate saving arguments for debugging\n        args = (x,)\n        kwargs = {'option': 1}\n        path = \"/tmp/test.pkl\"\n        with open(path, \"wb\") as f:\n            pickle.dump((args, kwargs), f)\n            \n        # This would trigger the vulnerable line when debugging\n        # load_args_and_run_compile_fx_inner(path)\n        return x\n",

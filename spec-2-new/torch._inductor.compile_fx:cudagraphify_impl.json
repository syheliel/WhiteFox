    "summary": "\nThe cudagraphify_impl function handles CUDA graph capture for PyTorch models. The vulnerable lines relate to:\n1. Precision: The static_outputs line may lose precision during CUDA graph capture due to direct tensor copying without proper type checking\n2. Security: The CUDA graph creation line could be vulnerable to memory access issues if inputs aren't properly validated before capture\nKey concerns:\n1. CUDA graphs capture kernel operations and memory addresses\n2. No explicit validation of input tensor types/precision\n3. Potential memory safety issues if graph captures invalid pointers\n",

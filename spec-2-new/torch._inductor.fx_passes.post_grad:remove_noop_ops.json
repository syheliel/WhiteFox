Replacing all uses of a no-op node with its source node\n2. Erasing the no-op node from the graph\nThese operations are dangerous because:\n1. They can incorrectly remove nodes that appear to be no-ops but have side effects\n2. They can break the graph if the replacement isn't properly validated\n3. They can cause incorrect results if metadata assumptions are wrong\n4. They don't properly handle cases where the no-op node is an output\n",

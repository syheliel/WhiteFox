    "summary": "\nThe remove_noop_ops function identifies and removes no-operation (noop) nodes from a PyTorch computational graph. These are operations that don't change the tensor's data or metadata (like aten.clone or aten.alias). The vulnerable lines handle:\n1. Replacing all uses of a noop node with its source node\n2. Erasing the noop node from the graph\nThe danger comes from:\n1. Incorrectly identifying nodes as noops when they actually perform meaningful operations\n2. Breaking graph correctness when removing nodes that have side effects\n3. Potential metadata mismatches between source and replacement nodes\n```\n\n```python\nclass NoopModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # These operations will be identified as noops\n        x1 = torch.clone(x)  # Will be replaced with x\n        x2 = x1.alias()     # Will be replaced with x1 (which was replaced with x)\n        x3 = self.conv(x2)\n        return x3\n",

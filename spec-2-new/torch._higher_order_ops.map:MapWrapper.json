    "summary": "\nThe map function applies a given function f to each slice of input tensors xs along their first dimension. The vulnerable lines perform input validation checks:\n1. The first check ensures all elements in xs are tensors, which is critical because the operation relies on tensor slicing\n2. The second check verifies consistent leading dimensions across all input tensors, which is necessary for proper batching\nThese validations prevent runtime errors but could provide more detailed error messages about which inputs failed validation\n",

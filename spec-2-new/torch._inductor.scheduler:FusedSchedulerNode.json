    "summary": "\nThe `reorder_loops_by_dep_pair` function in the scheduler is responsible for reordering loop iterations to optimize memory access patterns. The vulnerable line `assert self_sizes is not None` ensures that loop sizes are properly initialized before reordering. This check is important because:\n1. Loop sizes are needed to determine optimal iteration order\n2. Missing sizes would lead to incorrect loop reordering\n3. The fusion optimization relies on correct loop ordering\n4. Invalid sizes could cause crashes or incorrect results\n",

    "summary": "\nThe create_rot_n function generates bytecode instructions for rotating the top n items on the Python stack. The vulnerable line checks Python version compatibility for rotation operations with n >= 5, which were not supported before Python 3.10. This is important because:\n1. Stack rotation is used in bytecode generation for various operations\n2. Python versions before 3.10 had limited rotation capabilities\n3. Attempting to rotate 5+ items on older Python versions would fail\n4. The function raises an AttributeError for unsupported cases\n",

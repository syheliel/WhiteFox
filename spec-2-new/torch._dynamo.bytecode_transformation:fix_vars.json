    "summary": "\nThe fix_vars function handles variable loading and name resolution in PyTorch bytecode transformation. The vulnerable line checks for LOAD_GLOBAL instructions to handle global variable loading differently across Python versions. This is important because:\n1. Different Python versions handle global variable loading differently\n2. Missing proper version checks could lead to incorrect bytecode generation\n3. The function needs to maintain consistency with Python's variable resolution rules\n4. Improper handling could cause incorrect variable references or crashes\n```\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef example():\n    # This will trigger LOAD_GLOBAL handling in fix_vars\n    x = torch.randn(3, 3)\n    y = torch.nn.functional.relu(x)\n    return y\n```\n\n```yaml\n- torch.nn.functional.relu\n- torch.randn\n",

    "summary": "\nThe export function in TorchDynamo is used to convert PyTorch functions into FX graphs that can be executed outside PyTorch. The vulnerable line involves dynamic code execution through optimize_assert, which could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if untrusted inputs are processed. Key aspects:\n1. Handles graph capture and optimization\n2. Supports dynamic shapes and constraints\n3. Validates input/output signatures\n4. Contains potential security risks in dynamic code evaluation\n",

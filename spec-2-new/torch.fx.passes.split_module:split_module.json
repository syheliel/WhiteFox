    "summary": "\nThe split_module function is responsible for partitioning a GraphModule into submodules based on a partitioning policy. The vulnerable line `new_node.meta = node.meta.copy()` handles metadata copying between nodes during the partitioning process. This is important because:\n1. Metadata contains crucial information about tensor shapes and types\n2. Improper copying could lead to loss of precision information\n3. The metadata is used for subsequent graph transformations and optimizations\n4. Missing or incorrect metadata could affect model behavior\n",

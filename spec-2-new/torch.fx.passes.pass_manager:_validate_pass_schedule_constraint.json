The vulnerable line checks if passes in a list satisfy given constraints, but lacks proper validation of:\n1. The constraint function's signature (should take two callables and return bool)\n2. The passes list contents (should contain valid callable passes)\n3. Edge cases where constraints might be malformed\nThis could lead to runtime errors if invalid constraints or passes are provided.\n",

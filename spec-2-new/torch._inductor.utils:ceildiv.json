    "summary": "\nThe ceildiv function performs ceiling division on numeric inputs, handling both integers and sympy expressions. The vulnerable line checks that inputs are integers before performing runtime division, but fails to properly validate sympy expressions. This is important because:\n1. The function needs to handle both concrete integers and symbolic expressions\n2. Inadequate type checking could lead to incorrect results or errors\n3. The function assumes consistent input types for correct behavior\n4. Missing validation could cause issues when mixing integer and symbolic inputs\n",

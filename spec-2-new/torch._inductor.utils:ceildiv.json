    "summary": "\nThe ceildiv function performs ceiling division on either integers or sympy expressions. The vulnerable line checks that both numerator and denominator are Python integers before performing runtime division. This is problematic because:\n1. It doesn't properly handle sympy expressions which are valid inputs\n2. The assertion could fail unexpectedly when processing symbolic shapes\n3. The error message suggests there's a bug in calling code when it's actually a validation issue\n4. Missing proper validation could lead to incorrect results with symbolic inputs\n```\n\n```python\nclass ShapeModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Create symbolic shapes\n        batch = x.shape[0]\n        channels = x.shape[1]\n        # This will trigger the assertion when channels is symbolic\n        div = ceildiv(channels, 2)\n        return self.conv(x)[:, :div]\n",

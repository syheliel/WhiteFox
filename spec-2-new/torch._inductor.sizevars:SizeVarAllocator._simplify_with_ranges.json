The vulnerable line `expr = join_dimensions(self.simplify(expr))` combines modular indexing operations which could lead to precision loss when:\n1. Combining multiple ModularIndexing operations\n2. Converting ModularIndexing to FloorDiv operations\n3. Simplifying complex indexing expressions\n4. Potentially losing precision during dimension joining operations\n",

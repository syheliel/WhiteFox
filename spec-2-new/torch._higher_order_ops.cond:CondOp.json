    "summary": "\nThe cond_batch_rule function handles batched conditional operations in PyTorch's vmap transform. The vulnerable line uses torch.where for conditional selection between true and false branch outputs. This is important because:\n1. torch.where may have precision issues with floating-point comparisons\n2. The operation assumes consistent tensor shapes between branches\n3. The selection happens after evaluating both branches\n4. No explicit type checking is performed on the branch outputs\n",

    "summary": "\nThe cond_batch_rule function handles batched conditional operations in PyTorch's vmap transform. The vulnerable line uses torch.where for conditional selection which may cause precision issues with floating-point numbers because:\n1. torch.where performs element-wise selection\n2. Floating-point rounding errors can accumulate\n3. Both branches are evaluated before selection\n4. Precision differences may occur between branches\n```\n\n```python\nclass ConditionalModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 10)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Create a batched predicate tensor\n        pred = torch.rand(x.shape[0]) > 0.5\n        \n        def true_fn(x):\n            return self.linear(x) * 1.0\n            \n        def false_fn(x):\n            return self.linear(x) * 0.5\n            \n        # This will trigger the cond_batch_rule with torch.where\n        result = torch.vmap(torch.cond)(pred, true_fn, false_fn, (x,))\n        return result\n",

    "summary": "\nThe _check_conv_and_broadcast_op function validates conditions for fusing binary operations with convolution operations. The vulnerable lines handle:\n1. Argument checking for convolution bias node - incomplete validation could lead to incorrect fusion\n2. Type promotion validation - improper handling could cause precision loss when mixing different data types\n3. Broadcasting checks - ensures tensor shapes are compatible for fusion\n4. Floating-point validation - prevents fusing operations that would cause unwanted type promotion\n",

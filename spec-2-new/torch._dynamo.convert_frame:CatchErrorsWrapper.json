The vulnerable line checks for string-based code objects with `__new__` name to skip nametuple constructor cases. This validation is incomplete because:\n1. It doesn't verify other potential special cases that might need similar handling\n2. The string filename check could be bypassed with crafted input\n3. Other constructor patterns might need similar special handling\n4. Missing validation could lead to incorrect frame conversion behavior\n",

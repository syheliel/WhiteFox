    "summary": "\nThe _detect_cycles function is used to detect cycles in PyTorch computation graphs. The vulnerable line adds nodes to a pending queue for cycle detection. Key points:\n1. It performs depth-first search to detect cycles\n2. The pending.append() operation could lead to infinite loops if the graph is malformed\n3. Missing validation of node types could cause incorrect cycle detection\n4. The function is used internally for graph validation\n```\n\n```python\nclass CycleModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(10, 10)\n        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(10, 10)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Create a cycle in the computation graph\n        x1 = self.linear1(x)\n        x2 = self.linear2(x1)\n        x3 = self.linear1(x2)  # Reusing linear1 creates a cycle\n        return x3\n",

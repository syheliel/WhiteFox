    "summary": "\nThe _detect_cycles function performs cycle detection in PyTorch computational graphs. The vulnerable line adds nodes to a pending queue for cycle checking. Key points:\n1. It traverses graph nodes starting from placeholders\n2. Uses depth-first search to detect cycles\n3. Vulnerable to infinite loops if graph contains malformed connections\n4. Missing node type validation could lead to incorrect cycle detection\n",

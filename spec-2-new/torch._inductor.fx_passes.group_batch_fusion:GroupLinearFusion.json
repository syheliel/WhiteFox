    "summary": "\nThe GroupLinearFusion class handles fusing multiple linear operations in PyTorch graphs. The vulnerable lines involve:\n1. A hardcoded assumption that tensor dimensions must be even numbers (x % 2 == 0)\n2. A direct dependency on the external fbgemm library for fused operations\nThese assumptions could lead to:\n1. Incorrect behavior with odd-dimension tensors\n2. Potential security issues from external library dependencies\n3. Unexpected failures when tensor shapes don't meet requirements\n```\n\n```python\nclass LinearModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(16, 32)  # Even dimensions\n        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(16, 32)  # Even dimensions\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        x1 = self.linear1(x)\n        x2 = self.linear2(x)\n        return x1 + x2  # Will trigger fusion attempt\n",

    "summary": "\nThe GroupLinearFusion class handles fusing multiple linear operations in PyTorch graphs. The vulnerable lines involve:\n1. A hardcoded assumption that tensor dimensions must be even (x % 2 == 0)\n2. External dependency on fbgemm library for fused matrix multiplication\nKey implications:\n1. The even-dimension requirement may cause failures with odd-sized tensors\n2. The fbgemm dependency introduces potential security risks from external code\n3. The fusion assumes consistent tensor shapes across operations\n",

    "summary": "\nThe GroupLinearFusion class handles fusing multiple linear operations in PyTorch graphs. The vulnerable lines:\n1. Enforce that all tensor dimensions must be even numbers (hardcoded assumption)\n2. Use external fbgemm.gmm operation which may have security implications\nKey points:\n1. The fusion requires input and weight tensors to have even dimensions\n2. Uses fbgemm's gmm operation for fused computation\n3. Missing validation could lead to incorrect fused results if dimensions are odd\n4. External dependency on fbgemm may introduce security risks\n```\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass GroupLinear(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)\n        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        y1 = self.linear1(x)\n        y2 = self.linear2(x)\n        return y1 + y2\n\n# Input must have even dimensions to trigger fusion\nmodel = GroupLinear(64, 64)\nx = torch.randn(32, 64)  # 64 and 32 are even numbers\noutput = model(x)\n```\n\n```yaml\n- nn.Linear\n- torch.ops.fbgemm.gmm\n",

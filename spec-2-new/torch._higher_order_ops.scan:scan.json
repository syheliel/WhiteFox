    "summary": "\nThe generic_scan function performs an inclusive scan operation using a combine function. The vulnerable line handles scatter operations for storing intermediate results, which could lead to out-of-bounds access if indices are not properly validated. Key points:\n1. Scatter operation writes values to specified indices\n2. Indices are calculated by multiplying loop index with tensor\n3. No bounds checking is performed on the indices\n4. Malformed inputs could cause memory corruption\n```\n\n```python\nclass ScanModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(5))\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        def combine_fn(carry, x):\n            next_carry = carry + x * self.weight\n            output = next_carry * 0.5\n            return next_carry, output\n            \n        init = torch.zeros(5)\n        # Using large indices could trigger out-of-bounds in scatter\n        xs = torch.arange(100).reshape(10, 10)\n        carry, out = scan(combine_fn, init, xs, dim=0)\n        return out\n",

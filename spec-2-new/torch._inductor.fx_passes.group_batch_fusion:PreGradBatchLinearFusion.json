    "summary": "\nThe PreGradBatchLinearFusion class handles fusing multiple linear operations in PyTorch graphs before gradient computation. The vulnerable line performs batched matrix multiplication (bmm) during fusion, which can lead to precision loss when:\n1. Large matrices are multiplied in batch\n2. Numerical stability is compromised during bmm\n3. Input matrices have varying magnitudes\n4. Accumulated errors affect final results\n```\n\n```python\nclass LinearModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(1024, 2048)\n        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(1024, 2048)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        x1 = self.linear1(x)\n        x2 = self.linear2(x)\n        return x1 + x2\n",

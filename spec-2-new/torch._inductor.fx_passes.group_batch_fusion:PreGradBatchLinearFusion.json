    "summary": "\nThe PreGradBatchLinearFusion class handles fusing multiple linear operations in PyTorch graphs before gradient computation. The vulnerable line performs batched matrix multiplication (bmm) during fusion, which can lead to precision loss when:\n1. Large matrices are batched together\n2. Input values have wide numerical ranges\n3. Intermediate results accumulate rounding errors\n4. The fused operation combines matrices with different numerical properties\n",

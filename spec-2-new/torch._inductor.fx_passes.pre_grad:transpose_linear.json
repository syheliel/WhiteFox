    "summary": "\nThe transpose_linear function performs a linear transformation with an input transpose operation. The vulnerable line combines matrix multiplication and transpose operations which can lead to numerical precision issues because:\n1. Transposing matrices changes memory layout which can affect numerical stability\n2. Chained operations (transpose + matmul) can compound floating point errors\n3. The operation is commonly used in attention mechanisms where precision is critical\n4. The bias addition may further affect numerical properties\n",

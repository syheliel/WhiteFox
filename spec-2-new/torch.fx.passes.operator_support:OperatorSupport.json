    "summary": "\nThe `is_node_supported` function in OperatorSupport class checks if a given FX node is supported by verifying its input dtypes against predefined supported dtypes. The vulnerable line checks if an argument's dtype is in the supported dtypes list without proper epsilon comparison for floating point types, which could lead to precision issues. The function is used during graph transformation to determine which operations can be safely fused or optimized.\n```\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass MyModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, 3)\n        self.relu = nn.ReLU()\n    \n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.conv(x)\n        x = self.relu(x)\n        return x\n\nmodel = MyModel()\ntraced = torch.fx.symbolic_trace(model)\n# This will trigger dtype checking during graph optimization\noptimized = torch.fx.experimental.optimization.fuse(traced)\n```\n\n```yaml\n- nn.Conv2d\n- nn.ReLU\n- nn.Linear\n- nn.BatchNorm2d\n- nn.LayerNorm\n",

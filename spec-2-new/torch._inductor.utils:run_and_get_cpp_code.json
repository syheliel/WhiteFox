    "summary": "\nThe run_and_get_cpp_code function is used to execute a PyTorch function and capture its generated C++ code for debugging purposes. The vulnerable line enables debug mode through patching the config object, which could potentially expose sensitive information or debugging details that should not be accessible in production environments. This is problematic because:\n1. Debug mode may expose internal implementation details\n2. Could leak sensitive information through debug outputs\n3. May impact performance when enabled unintentionally\n4. Should be carefully controlled in production environments\n```\n\n```python\nclass DebugModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 10)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.linear(x)\n        return x\n\ndef trigger_debug():\n    model = DebugModel()\n    x = torch.randn(1, 10)\n    result, code = run_and_get_cpp_code(model, x)\n    return result, code\n",

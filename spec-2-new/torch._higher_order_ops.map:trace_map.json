    "summary": "\nThe trace_map function handles tracing operations for the map higher-order operator in PyTorch. The vulnerable line performs tensor expansion which might not preserve precision for certain dtypes or quantization schemes. This is important because:\n1. Tensor expansion can affect numerical precision\n2. Certain dtypes (like low-precision floats) may lose precision during expansion\n3. Quantization schemes may be disrupted by expansion operations\n4. The expansion happens during graph tracing and could affect subsequent operations\n",

    "summary": "\nThe evaluate_max function in SizeVarAllocator is used to determine the larger of two symbolic expressions while ensuring consistency with guards. It relies on evaluate_min internally, which may lose precision when handling unbacked symbolic integers (symints) due to fallback to size hints. This can lead to incorrect maximum value determination when:\n1. The expressions contain unbacked symints\n2. The expressions are mathematically equal but structurally different\n3. The gcd-based fallback logic fails to find a precise solution\n```\n\n```python\nclass MaxModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 10)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Create two expressions that should be equal but structurally different\n        t1 = self.linear(x).sum()\n        t2 = self.linear(x).sum(dim=1).sum()\n        \n        # This will trigger evaluate_max which internally uses evaluate_min\n        # With unbacked symints, this may lose precision\n        max_val = torch.max(t1, t2)\n        return max_val\n",

    "summary": "\nThe evaluate_max function in SizeVarAllocator is used to determine the larger of two symbolic expressions while ensuring consistency with guards. The vulnerable line relies on evaluate_min which may lose precision when handling unbacked symbolic integers (symints). This is important because:\n1. It's used for size computations and loop optimizations\n2. Precision loss could lead to incorrect bounds calculations\n3. The function assumes evaluate_min will handle all cases correctly\n4. Missing proper handling of unbacked symints could cause runtime errors\n",

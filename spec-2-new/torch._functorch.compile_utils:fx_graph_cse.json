Hash collisions between different tensors\n2. Incorrect CSE optimizations due to false matches\n3. Potential precision issues in graph transformations\n4. Undetected differences between tensors with same hash\n```\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.fx as fx\n\nclass MyModule(torch.nn.Module):\n    def forward(self, x, y):\n        a = x + y\n        b = x + y  # This duplicate operation should be eliminated by CSE\n        return a * b\n\nmodel = MyModule()\ntraced = fx.symbolic_trace(model)\noptimized_graph = fx_graph_cse(traced.graph)\n```\n\n```yaml\n- fx.symbolic_trace\n- fx.GraphModule\n- fx.Node\n- torch.fx.graph.Graph\n",

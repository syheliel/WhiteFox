    "summary": "\nThe fx_graph_cse function performs common subexpression elimination (CSE) on PyTorch FX graphs. The vulnerable line uses hash for tensor comparison which may lead to precision issues due to hash collisions. This is important because:\n1. Hash collisions could incorrectly identify different tensors as identical\n2. Precision errors could propagate through the graph\n3. The optimization might produce incorrect results silently\n4. Tensor comparisons should use exact value matching rather than hashing\n",

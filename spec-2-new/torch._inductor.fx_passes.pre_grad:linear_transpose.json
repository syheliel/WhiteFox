    "summary": "\nThe linear_transpose function performs a matrix multiplication between a weight matrix and the transpose of an input tensor, then adds a bias term. The vulnerable line combines these operations which can lead to numerical precision issues because:\n1. Matrix multiplication with transposed inputs can amplify floating-point errors\n2. The bias addition after matmul may compound numerical inaccuracies\n3. The unsqueeze operation could affect numerical stability\n4. Precision loss is more likely with large matrices or extreme values\n",

    "summary": "\nThe linear_transpose function performs a matrix multiplication between weight and transposed input tensors, then adds a bias term. The vulnerable line combines these operations which can lead to numerical precision issues because:\n1. Matrix multiplication with transposed inputs can amplify floating-point errors\n2. The bias addition after matmul may compound numerical inaccuracies\n3. The operation order (transpose -> matmul -> bias) is sensitive to input scale\n4. No numerical stability safeguards are present\n```\n\n```python\nclass LinearTransposeModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(128, 256)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Transpose input and perform linear operation\n        weight = self.linear.weight\n        bias = self.linear.bias\n        # This will trigger the vulnerable line\n        return torch.matmul(weight, x.transpose(-1, -2)) + bias.unsqueeze(-1)\n",

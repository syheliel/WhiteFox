The vulnerable line performs direct code object transformation which could potentially allow code injection if untrusted input reaches this point. This is critical because:\n1. It operates at the bytecode level with full code generation capabilities\n2. There's no validation of the transformed code's safety\n3. Maliciously crafted bytecode could bypass Python's normal security checks\n4. The transformation happens deep in the compilation pipeline where errors are hard to trace\n",

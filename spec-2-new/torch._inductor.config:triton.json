    "summary": "\nThe triton.codegen_upcast_to_fp32 configuration controls whether float16/bfloat16 operations are automatically upcast to float32 during Triton code generation. This setting is important because:\n1. Upcasting can improve numerical stability for some operations\n2. However, it may lead to unnecessary precision conversion overhead\n3. Some models may perform adequately with lower precision\n4. Automatic upcasting could mask precision-related issues that should be addressed at model level\n```\n\n```python\nclass PrecisionModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3)\n        self.fc = nn.Linear(16*26*26, 10)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = x.half()  # Convert input to float16\n        x = self.conv(x)\n        x = torch.relu(x)\n        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)\n        x = self.fc(x)\n        return x\n",

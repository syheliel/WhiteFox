    "summary": "\nThe draw_buffers function visualizes a computation graph by creating a Graphviz diagram from scheduler nodes. The vulnerable line creates TensorMetadata with incomplete information (only group and dtype), which could lead to:\n1. Inaccurate graph visualization due to missing tensor shape/strides\n2. Potential precision issues in graph analysis tools\n3. Incorrect optimization decisions based on partial metadata\n4. Debugging difficulties when tensor dimensions are needed\n```\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass ModelWithGraph(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, 3)\n        self.relu = nn.ReLU()\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.conv(x)\n        x = self.relu(x)\n        return x\n\nmodel = ModelWithGraph()\nx = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32)\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    traced = torch.fx.symbolic_trace(model)\n    # This would trigger draw_buffers internally when visualization is enabled\n    torch._inductor.debug.draw_buffers(traced.graph.nodes)\n```\n\n```yaml\n- nn.Conv2d\n- nn.ReLU\n- torch.fx.symbolic_trace\n",

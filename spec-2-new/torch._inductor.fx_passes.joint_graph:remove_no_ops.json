    "summary": "\nThe remove_no_ops function in PyTorch is responsible for eliminating no-op operations like adding zero or multiplying by one from the computation graph. The vulnerable lines involve:\n1. Precision comparison of tensor metadata (shape, dtype, device) which could lead to incorrect optimizations if the comparison is not exact\n2. Incomplete argument type checking that could miss some edge cases where non-Node arguments are passed\nThese issues could potentially cause:\n1. Incorrect graph optimizations due to imprecise tensor comparisons\n2. Runtime errors if unexpected argument types are processed\n```\n\n```python\nclass SimpleModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(3, 3))\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # These operations could trigger the vulnerable lines\n        t1 = x + 0  # Addition with zero (no-op)\n        t2 = t1 * 1  # Multiplication with one (no-op)\n        t3 = t2 @ self.weight\n        return t3\n",

    "summary": "\nThe remove_no_ops function handles removing no-op operations (like adding 0 or multiplying by 1) from PyTorch graphs. The vulnerable lines involve:\n1. Comparing tensor metadata (shape, dtype, device) without considering numerical precision\n2. Incomplete argument type checking that could lead to incorrect graph transformations\nKey implications:\n1. Precision loss could occur when comparing tensor values for equality\n2. Missing type checks could allow invalid operations to pass through\n3. The function assumes tensor metadata comparison is sufficient for optimization decisions\n",

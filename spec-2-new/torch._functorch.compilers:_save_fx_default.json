    "summary": "\nThe _save_fx_default function is responsible for saving forward, backward, and joint computation graphs along with their input metadata. The vulnerable lines involve:\n1. Unsafe pickle file handling which could lead to arbitrary code execution if malicious pickle data is loaded\n2. Lack of path validation when creating directories which could lead to directory traversal attacks\n3. Both issues could be exploited if an attacker controls the folder_name or input_meta parameters\n```\n\n```python\nclass ModelGraphSaver(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 10)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.linear(x)\n        return x\n\ndef trigger_vulnerability():\n    model = ModelGraphSaver()\n    example_input = torch.randn(1, 10)\n    \n    # Malicious path that could exploit directory traversal\n    folder_name = \"../../malicious/path\" \n    \n    # Using pickle.dump with untrusted data\n    save_func = graph_dumper_aot(\"vulnerable_model\", folder_name, True)\n    optimized_model = torch.compile(model, backend=save_func)\n    \n    with torch.enable_grad():\n        output = optimized_model(example_input)\n        output.sum().backward()\n",

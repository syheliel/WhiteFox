    "summary": "\nThe tensor_is_aligned function checks if a tensor's memory is properly aligned for GPU operations. The vulnerable line performs alignment calculations that could lead to precision issues due to:\n1. Multiplication of storage_offset and dtype size\n2. Modulo operation with GPU_ALIGN_BYTES\n3. Potential integer overflow in calculations\n4. Incorrect alignment detection due to precision loss\n",

    "summary": "\nThe tensor_is_aligned function checks if a tensor's storage offset multiplied by its dtype size is aligned to GPU_ALIGN_BYTES. The vulnerable line performs this check using multiplication and modulo operations which could lead to:\n1. Potential precision loss in floating-point calculations\n2. Integer overflow in the multiplication\n3. Incorrect alignment detection due to numerical instability\n4. Problems with large storage offsets or unusual dtype sizes\n```\n\n```python\nclass AlignmentChecker(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Create a tensor with large storage offset that could cause overflow\n        y = x[:, :, 1:, 1:]  # Creates a view with non-zero offset\n        # This will trigger the alignment check with potential precision issues\n        return self.conv(y)\n",

    "summary": "\nThe CondAutogradOp.backward function handles gradient computation for conditional operations in PyTorch. The vulnerable line computes gradients through conditional branches which may lead to precision loss because:\n1. It uses cond_op to select between true and false branch gradients\n2. The branch selection is based on the original predicate value\n3. Different branches may compute gradients with different numerical precision\n4. The fusion of gradients from different branches could amplify precision errors\n```\n\n```python\nclass ConditionalModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 5)\n        \n    def forward(self, x, condition):\n        # Branch selection based on condition\n        if condition:\n            out = torch.sin(self.linear(x))\n        else:\n            out = torch.cos(self.linear(x))\n        return out.sum()  # Return scalar for gradient computation\n\n# Example usage\nmodel = ConditionalModel()\nx = torch.randn(3, 10, requires_grad=True)\ncondition = torch.tensor(True)\nloss = model(x, condition)\nloss.backward()  # Triggers the vulnerable backward pass\n",

    "summary": "\nThe backward function in CondAutogradOp handles gradient computation for conditional operations. The vulnerable line computes gradients by conditionally applying either the true or false branch's backward graph based on the original predicate. This is important because:\n1. Gradient computation depends on which branch was taken in forward pass\n2. Precision loss could occur if the backward graphs have different numerical behaviors\n3. The conditional gradient computation must match the forward pass branch\n4. Incorrect gradients could propagate through the computation graph\n",

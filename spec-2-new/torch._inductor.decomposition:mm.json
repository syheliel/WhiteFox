    "summary": "\nThe `mm` function performs matrix multiplication with device-specific optimizations. The vulnerable line checks if coordinate descent tuning is enabled and the device is not CPU/MPS before applying optimizations. This is important because:\n1. Different devices may have varying performance characteristics\n2. The optimization path changes based on device type\n3. Results could differ across platforms due to different optimization strategies\n4. The condition affects whether special cases for matrix-vector products are used\n",

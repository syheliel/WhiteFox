    "summary": "\nThe DebugInterpreter.run_node function performs validation checks during FX graph interpretation. The vulnerable lines handle:\n1. Strict dtype checking between expected (nv) and actual (rv) tensor values\n2. Missing handling for quantized tensor types during type checking\nKey implications:\n1. May fail for numerically equivalent but different dtype tensors\n2. Doesn't properly support quantized tensor operations\n3. Could reject valid computations due to overly strict checks\n4. Missing quantization support could lead to incorrect interpretations\n",

    "summary": "\nThe transform_code_object function handles bytecode transformations in PyTorch. The vulnerable line checks that the length of co_varnames matches co_nlocals before proceeding with transformations. This is important because:\n1. co_varnames contains all local variable names\n2. co_nlocals should match the number of local variables\n3. Mismatch could indicate corrupted bytecode\n4. Missing validation could lead to incorrect transformations if counts differ\n```\n\n```python\nclass VulnerableModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.layer = nn.Linear(10, 10)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # This will trigger the assertion when transformed\n        # because we're creating a closure with different variable counts\n        def inner():\n            y = x * 2\n            z = y + 1\n            return z\n            \n        return self.layer(inner())\n",

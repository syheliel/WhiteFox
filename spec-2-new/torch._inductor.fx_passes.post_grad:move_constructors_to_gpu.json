    "summary": "\nThe ConstructorMoverPass class handles moving tensor constructors from CPU to GPU in PyTorch graphs. The vulnerable line initiates this movement process. This is important because:\n1. Moving constructors to GPU can improve performance by reducing CPU-GPU transfers\n2. The pass must carefully validate which constructors can be safely moved\n3. Incorrect movement could lead to device mismatch errors\n4. The pass maintains correctness by tracking dependencies between operations\n```\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass ModelWithConstructors(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 10)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # CPU constructor that could be moved to GPU\n        ones = torch.ones(10, device='cpu')\n        x = self.linear(x)\n        return x + ones  # This addition would trigger the constructor movement\n```\n\n```yaml\n- nn.Linear\n- torch.ones\n- torch.zeros\n- torch.empty\n- torch.rand\n- torch.randn\n",

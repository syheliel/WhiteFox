    "summary": "\nThe move_constructors_to_gpu function is responsible for moving tensor constructors from CPU to GPU when safe. The vulnerable line calls ConstructorMoverPass to perform this operation. Key points:\n1. It sweeps through the graph looking for constructor nodes\n2. Moves them to GPU only if all their users can also be moved\n3. Handles device dependencies between nodes\n4. Vulnerable to improper device movement that could cause:\n   - Incorrect device placement\n   - Broken computational graphs\n   - Silent errors in mixed device scenarios\n```\n\n```python\nclass ModelWithConstructors(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 10)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Creates CPU tensor that will be moved to GPU\n        ones = torch.ones(10, 10)\n        # Mixed device operation that could trigger the vulnerability\n        x = self.linear(x) + ones.to(x.device)\n        return x\n",

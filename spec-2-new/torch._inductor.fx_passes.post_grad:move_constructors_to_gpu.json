    "summary": "\nThe move_constructors_to_gpu function is responsible for moving tensor constructors from CPU to GPU when safe. The vulnerable line calls ConstructorMoverPass which:\n1. Identifies CPU tensor constructors in the graph\n2. Determines if they can be safely moved to GPU\n3. Updates their device placement if safe\n4. Handles dependencies between operations\n5. Prevents unsafe moves that could break graph execution\nThe function is part of PyTorch's graph optimization passes that aim to improve performance by moving operations to GPU.\n",

    "summary": "\nThe prologue_fusion_enabled function determines whether prologue fusion optimizations should be enabled based on version comparison. The vulnerable line compares a version number against a constant threshold to decide if fusion should be enabled. This is important because:\n1. Version comparison logic needs to be precise to avoid incorrect optimization decisions\n2. Mismatched version comparisons could lead to enabling/disabling optimizations incorrectly\n3. The function uses both environment variables and internal version checks\n4. Precision issues in version comparison could affect optimization behavior\n",

    "summary": "\nThe `inner` function is a wrapper used in foreach operations that applies a pointwise function to multiple tensors. The vulnerable line returns the result of applying the function, but foreach operations may accumulate precision errors due to:\n1. Repeated application of the pointwise operation\n2. Potential loss of precision when fusing multiple operations\n3. Differences from eager mode execution\n4. Lack of explicit error bounds control\n",

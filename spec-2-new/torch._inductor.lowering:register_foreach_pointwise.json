    "summary": "\nThe `inner` function is a helper function used in foreach operations that applies a pointwise operation to each element in a list of tensors. The vulnerable line indicates potential precision issues when accumulating results across multiple operations in foreach loops. This is important because:\n1. Foreach operations process multiple tensors in parallel\n2. Floating-point arithmetic can accumulate rounding errors\n3. Precision errors may compound across multiple operations\n4. Results may differ from sequential execution\n```\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass ForeachAdd(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(ForeachAdd, self).__init__()\n        \n    def forward(self, x, y):\n        # Using foreach_add operation\n        return torch._foreach_add(x, y)\n```\n\n```yaml\n- torch._foreach_add\n- torch._foreach_mul\n- torch._foreach_sub\n- torch._foreach_div\n",

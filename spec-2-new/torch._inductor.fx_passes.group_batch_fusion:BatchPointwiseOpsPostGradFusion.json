    "summary": "\nThe BatchPointwiseOpsPostGradFusion class handles fusing pointwise operations (like tanh, sigmoid, relu) in PyTorch graphs during the post-grad pass. The vulnerable line updates the metadata ('val') of the fused operation by applying the pointwise op to stacked inputs. This is important because:\n1. It maintains correct type and shape information for the fused operation\n2. Incorrect metadata could lead to downstream optimization errors\n3. The fusion assumes consistent input types and shapes\n4. Missing validation could propagate incorrect type information\n```\n\n```python\nclass TanhModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(10, 20)\n        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(10, 20)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        x1 = self.linear1(x)\n        x2 = self.linear2(x)\n        t1 = torch.tanh(x1)\n        t2 = torch.tanh(x2)\n        return t1 + t2\n",

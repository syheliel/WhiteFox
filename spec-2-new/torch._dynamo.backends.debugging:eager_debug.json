    "summary": "\nThe eager_debug function is a debugging backend that enables schema validation for custom operators during graph execution. The vulnerable line wraps the graph execution in SchemaCheckMode, which:\n1. Validates operator schemas during execution\n2. Helps catch incorrect operator implementations\n3. Adds runtime overhead due to validation checks\n4. Primarily used for debugging custom dispatcher ops\n```\n\n```python\nclass CustomOpModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 10)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # This will trigger schema validation in eager_debug mode\n        x = self.linear(x)\n        x = torch.relu(x)\n        # Custom operation that might have schema issues\n        x = x * 2.0\n        return x\n",

    "summary": "\nThe preserve_global_state function is a context manager that saves and restores various global states in PyTorch during frame conversion. The vulnerable line handles the restoration of the cuBLAS TF32 precision setting, which is important for numerical stability and reproducibility in CUDA operations. The issue is that TF32 precision settings may not be properly preserved across state changes, potentially leading to inconsistent numerical results.\n\nThe has_tensor_in_frame function checks if a Python frame contains tensor-related operations that need to be traced. The vulnerable line checks for tensor presence but may improperly validate numpy arrays when config.trace_numpy is enabled, potentially missing some tensor-related operations that should be traced.\n",

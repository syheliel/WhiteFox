    "summary": "\nThe aot_module_simplified function is used to simplify the AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) compilation process for PyTorch modules. The vulnerable line merges named parameters and buffers into a single dictionary, which could potentially lead to type confusion issues if the parameters and buffers have overlapping names or incompatible types. This is important because:\n1. Parameters and buffers are both stored in the module's state_dict\n2. They serve different purposes (parameters are learned, buffers are not)\n3. Merging them without proper type checking could cause runtime errors\n4. The function assumes parameters and buffers won't have naming conflicts\n",

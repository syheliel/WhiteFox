    "summary": "\nThe `__call__` method in `FxNetAccFusionsFinder` is responsible for finding fusion groups of ACC nodes in a PyTorch graph. The vulnerable line checks if all nodes in a fusion group are ACC nodes before adding them to the result. The race condition occurs because:\n1. The method iterates over `self.acc_nodes`\n2. It potentially modifies `self.acc_nodes` during iteration\n3. This could lead to inconsistent behavior or skipped nodes\n4. The operation isn't thread-safe if called concurrently\n",

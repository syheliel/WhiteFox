    "summary": "\nThe apply_input_props_using_example function is used to propagate tensor properties from example inputs to a graph's inputs in PyTorch's JIT compiler. The vulnerable lines involve:\n1. Input length validation that could be more clearly expressed with !=\n2. Type inference for tensors without proper result checking\n3. Boolean comparison that might have edge cases\nThese operations are critical for:\n1. Ensuring graph inputs match expected types\n2. Maintaining type consistency during JIT compilation\n3. Preventing type-related errors in compiled graphs\n",

    "summary": "\nThe lower_scan_to_loop function handles converting scan operations to while_loop operations in PyTorch graphs. The vulnerable line performs pattern matching and replacement of scan operations with while_loop implementations. This is important because:\n1. It transforms higher-order scan operations into more basic while_loop operations\n2. The replacement must maintain mathematical equivalence\n3. Incorrect pattern matching could lead to wrong graph transformations\n4. The replacement affects performance optimization and memory usage\n",

    "summary": "\nThe decide_compile_threads function determines the number of threads to use for compilation in PyTorch Inductor. The vulnerable line sets the thread count by taking the minimum between 32 and the system's CPU count. The issue is:\n1. No validation is performed on the cpu_count value\n2. An invalid cpu_count could lead to incorrect thread count configuration\n3. This could affect compilation performance and resource usage\n4. The function is used during PyTorch model compilation setup\n",

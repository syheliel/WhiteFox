    "summary": "\nThe ConstructorMoverPass class handles moving tensor constructors from CPU to a target device (like GPU) in PyTorch graphs. The vulnerable line updates the device parameter in kwargs to the target device. This is important because:\n1. It changes where tensors are allocated and computed\n2. Incorrect device movement could lead to performance issues or errors\n3. The pass must ensure all dependent operations can handle the device change\n4. Missing validation could lead to invalid device transfers\n",

    "summary": "\nThe ConstructorMoverPass class handles moving tensor constructors from CPU to GPU devices in PyTorch graphs. The vulnerable line updates the device parameter in kwargs to the target GPU device. This is important because:\n1. It modifies tensor creation locations which affects memory placement\n2. Incorrect device assignment could lead to runtime errors\n3. The transformation assumes all downstream operations can handle GPU tensors\n4. Missing validation could move tensors that shouldn't be moved\n```\n\n```python\nclass ModelWithConstructors(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(10, 10))\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Creates CPU tensor that could be moved to GPU\n        bias = torch.zeros(10)  \n        return x @ self.weight + bias\n",

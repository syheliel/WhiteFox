The vulnerable line assumes the type_ metadata is either a Tensor class or None, but doesn't handle cases where:\n1. type_ could be a Union type containing Tensor\n2. type_ could be a subclass of Tensor but with additional type annotations\n3. The metadata might contain type hints that aren't direct class objects\nThis could lead to false negatives when checking tensor outputs in complex type scenarios.\n",

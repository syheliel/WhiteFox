    "summary": "\nThe `should_compile_partial_graph` function determines whether Dynamo should compile a partial subgraph when encountering unsupported operations. The vulnerable line checks that `self.one_graph` is False before allowing partial compilation. This is important because:\n1. The `one_graph` flag indicates whether the entire function must be compiled as a single graph\n2. Missing validation could lead to incorrect compilation behavior when `one_graph=True`\n3. Partial compilation assumes the ability to break and resume execution\n4. The function also checks for active context managers that don't support graph breaks\n\nThe `create_call_resume_at` function handles installing global variables for resuming execution after graph breaks. The vulnerable line installs a global variable without proper validation, which could potentially be exploited.\n",

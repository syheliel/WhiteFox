    "summary": "\nThe graphsafe_rng_functionalization flag controls whether CUDA graph execution will use functional RNG operations. When enabled, it converts PyTorch's random number generation operations to their functional equivalents for CUDA graphs. This is important because:\n1. CUDA graphs require deterministic operations\n2. Functional RNG provides reproducibility in graph captures\n3. Precision may be affected due to different RNG implementations\n4. The flag defaults to True but may have numerical accuracy implications\n```\n\n```python\nclass RNGModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Random dropout will be affected by graphsafe_rng_functionalization\n        x = F.dropout(x, p=0.5, training=True)\n        x = self.conv(x)\n        # Random noise addition will use functional RNG if flag is True\n        x = x + torch.randn_like(x) * 0.1\n        return x\n",

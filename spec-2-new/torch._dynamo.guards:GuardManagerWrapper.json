    "summary": "\nThe GuardBuilder.__init__ method initializes a cache dictionary `_cached_guard_managers` that maps source names to GuardManager objects. The vulnerable line shows this cache is not bounded, which could lead to:\n1. Unbounded memory growth if sources are frequently created\n2. Potential denial of service if attackers can trigger source creation\n3. Cache pollution if malicious inputs generate many unique sources\n4. No eviction policy for old/stale entries\n",

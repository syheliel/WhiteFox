    "summary": "\nThe llvm_target function determines the appropriate LLVM target CPU flags based on system capabilities. The vulnerable line returns a hardcoded \"skylake-avx512\" CPU target when AVX512 is detected in /proc/cpuinfo. This is problematic because:\n1. The detection only checks for AVX512 presence in /proc/cpuinfo\n2. The hardcoded skylake-avx512 target may not match all AVX512-capable CPUs\n3. Different AVX512-capable CPUs may require different optimization flags\n4. Missing validation could lead to suboptimal performance or incorrect optimizations\n",

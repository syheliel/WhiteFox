    "summary": "\nThe llvm_target function determines the appropriate LLVM target CPU flags based on system capabilities. The vulnerable line hardcodes \"llvm -mcpu=skylake-avx512\" when AVX512 is detected, which could cause issues because:\n1. Not all AVX512-capable CPUs use the skylake architecture\n2. Different AVX512 implementations may have varying instruction sets\n3. The hardcoded value doesn't account for newer AVX512 variants\n4. Incorrect CPU flags could lead to suboptimal performance or runtime errors\n```\n\n```python\nclass VectorModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(512, 512)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # This operation will benefit from AVX512 if available\n        x = self.linear(x)\n        x = torch.relu(x)\n        x = x * x  # Square operation that can use vector instructions\n        return x\n",

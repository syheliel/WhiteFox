    "summary": "\nThe RETURN_VALUE function in InliningInstructionTranslator handles returning values from inlined function calls. The vulnerable line assigns the popped stack value directly to symbolic_result without proper type checking or precision handling. This is important because:\n1. Inlined functions may return values of varying types/precision\n2. Direct assignment could lose type information or precision\n3. Missing validation could lead to incorrect symbolic execution results\n4. The function is called during critical inlining operations\n\nThe check_inlineable function validates whether a function can be inlined. The vulnerable assertion assumes the function is inlineable without sufficient validation, which could lead to incorrect inlining decisions.\n```\n\n```python\nclass TestModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 10)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # This could trigger precision loss during inlining\n        def inner_fn(x):\n            return x * 0.5  # Returns floating point value\n            \n        # This could trigger the insufficient validation case\n        def skipped_fn(x):\n            return x\n            \n        y = inner_fn(x)\n        z = skipped_fn(x)\n        return self.linear(y + z)\n",

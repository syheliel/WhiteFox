    "summary": "\nThe BatchPointwiseOpsPreGradFusion class handles fusing multiple pointwise operations (like tanh, sigmoid, relu) in PyTorch graphs during the pre-gradient pass. The vulnerable line updates the example value metadata for batched operations, which could lead to precision loss because:\n1. Pointwise operations may have different numerical properties when batched\n2. The example value metadata is used for optimization decisions\n3. Precision differences could accumulate across multiple operations\n4. The fusion assumes numerical equivalence between batched and individual operations\n```\n\n```python\nclass PointwiseModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.weights = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(3, 4))\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        x1 = torch.tanh(x * self.weights[0])\n        x2 = torch.tanh(x * self.weights[1])\n        x3 = torch.tanh(x * self.weights[2])\n        return x1 + x2 + x3\n",

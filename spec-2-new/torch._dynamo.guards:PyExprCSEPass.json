    "summary": "\nThe PyExprCSEPass class performs common sub-expression elimination (CSE) on Python expressions during guard generation. The vulnerable line involves unparsing AST nodes which could be expensive for large expressions. This is important because:\n1. AST unparsing is done for every sub-expression during CSE\n2. Large expressions could cause performance issues\n3. The operation is quadratic on AST depth\n4. This happens during guard generation which is performance critical\n",

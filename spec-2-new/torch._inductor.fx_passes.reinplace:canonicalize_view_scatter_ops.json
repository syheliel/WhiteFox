    "summary": "\nThe handle_views function tracks view operations and their base tensors in PyTorch graphs. The vulnerable line maintains a mapping between view nodes and their base tensors. This is important because:\n1. View operations create new tensors sharing storage with their base\n2. Incorrect base tracking could lead to wrong transformations during optimization\n3. The mapping is used for scatter operation fusion and canonicalization\n4. Type inference issues here could cause incorrect graph transformations\n```\n\n```python\nclass ViewTrackingModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Create base tensor\n        base = self.conv(x)\n        \n        # Create multiple views\n        view1 = base[:, :, 1:-1, 1:-1]  # slice view\n        view2 = view1.permute(0, 2, 3, 1)  # permute view\n        view3 = view2.reshape(-1, 16)  # reshape view\n        \n        # Use views in computation\n        out = torch.relu(view3)\n        return out\n",

    "summary": "\nThe handle_views function tracks view operations in PyTorch graphs by maintaining a mapping between nodes and their base tensors. The vulnerable line attempts to get the base tensor for a view operation, but may have type inference issues when:\n1. Handling complex view operations chains\n2. Dealing with mixed tensor types\n3. Processing views of views\n4. Maintaining consistency across graph transformations\n",

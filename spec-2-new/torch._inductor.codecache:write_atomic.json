    "summary": "\nThe write_atomic function handles atomic file writes in PyTorch's caching system. The vulnerable line performs a file rename operation on Windows, which can lead to race conditions because:\n1. Windows file operations are not atomic by default\n2. The rename operation may fail if the target file exists\n3. No proper error handling for concurrent access scenarios\n4. The temporary file cleanup may not be reliable in race conditions\n```\n\n```python\nclass CacheWriter(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.counter = 0\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Simulate concurrent cache writing\n        content = f\"data_{self.counter}\".encode()\n        self.counter += 1\n        \n        # This could trigger the race condition in write_atomic\n        path = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), f\"cache_{id(self)}.tmp\")\n        write_atomic(path, content)\n        \n        return x\n",

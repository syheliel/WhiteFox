The vulnerable line performs a file rename operation on Windows, which can lead to race conditions because:\n1. Windows file operations are not atomic by default\n2. Multiple processes may attempt to rename files simultaneously\n3. The temporary file creation and rename operations are not properly synchronized\n4. FileExistsError is caught but may mask other race conditions\n",

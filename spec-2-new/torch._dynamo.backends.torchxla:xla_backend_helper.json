No validation of model or input arguments before compilation (extract_compiled_graph)\n2. Direct execution of compiled graph without safety checks (compiled_graph(*args))\nThese vulnerabilities could allow:\n1. Execution of untrusted/malicious models\n2. Potential code injection through crafted input tensors\n3. Unsafe execution of modified compiled graphs\n```\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nmodel = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(10, 10), nn.ReLU())\ninputs = torch.randn(1, 10)\n\n# This would trigger both vulnerable lines through normal PyTorch usage\ncompiled_model = torch.compile(model, backend='openxla')\noutput = compiled_model(inputs)\n```\n\n```yaml\n- torch.compile\n- nn.Sequential\n- nn.Linear\n- nn.ReLU\n",

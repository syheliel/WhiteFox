Input metadata mutations (like .resize_()) which are banned in export mode\n2. Functionalized RNG operations which may affect quantization behavior\nKey points:\n- Missing validation for input mutations in non-export cases\n- RNG operations may unexpectedly impact quantization results\n- These checks are critical for maintaining graph correctness and numerical stability\n```\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass MutatingModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 10)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # This resize mutation would be caught in export mode\n        # but might slip through in non-export cases\n        x.resize_(20, 10)\n        return self.linear(x)\n\nmodel = MutatingModel()\nx = torch.randn(10, 10)\n# This would trigger the missing mutation check in non-export mode\noutput = torch.compile(model)(x)\n```\n\n```yaml\n- nn.Linear\n- torch.compile\n- torch.resize_\n",

Input metadata mutations in export cases (resize_/transpose_ ops)\n2. Functionalization of RNG operations which can affect quantization\nKey implications:\n1. Missing mutation checks in non-export cases could allow unsafe operations\n2. RNG functionalization may produce different results than eager mode\n3. These checks are critical for maintaining graph correctness\n4. The conditions affect both training and inference graphs\n```\n\n```python\nclass MutationModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Potential metadata mutation\n        x = x.transpose(1, 2)  \n        # RNG operation that could be functionalized\n        if torch.rand(1) > 0.5:\n            x = self.conv(x)\n        else:\n            x = x.mean(dim=1, keepdim=True)\n        return x\n",

    "summary": "\nThe round_dec function performs rounding of a tensor to a specified number of decimal places. The vulnerable line calculates 10 raised to the power of decimals, which is used to scale the input before and after rounding. This is important because:\n1. Floating-point exponentiation can introduce precision errors\n2. These errors may propagate through the rounding operation\n3. The final result may not match exact decimal rounding expectations\n4. Precision issues could affect downstream calculations\n",

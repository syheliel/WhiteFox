    "summary": "\nThe round_dec function performs rounding with decimal places specified by the decimals parameter. The vulnerable line calculates 10^decimals which could introduce floating point precision errors when:\n1. The decimals parameter is large\n2. The input tensor contains very small or very large values\n3. The operation is performed on hardware with limited floating point precision\n4. The result is used in subsequent calculations where precision matters\n```\n\n```python\nclass RoundModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 10)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.linear(x)\n        # Trigger rounding with large decimals value\n        x = torch.round(x, decimals=15)  # This will use round_dec internally\n        return x\n",

    "summary": "\nThe round_dec function handles decimal rounding of tensors by scaling values by 10^decimals before rounding and then scaling back. The vulnerable line calculates the scaling factor using floating point exponentiation, which can introduce precision errors because:\n1. Floating point operations are not exact\n2. The 10.0**decimals calculation may have small errors\n3. These errors propagate through the rounding operation\n4. Could lead to incorrect rounding results for certain decimal values\n```\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\nx = torch.tensor([1.2345, 5.6789])\nrounded = torch.round(x * (10.0**2)) * (1.0 / (10.0**2))  # Round to 2 decimal places\n```\n\n```yaml\n- torch.round\n- torch.Tensor.round\n",

    "summary": "\nThe evaluate_expr function handles symbolic expression evaluation in PyTorch's shape environment. The vulnerable line directly converts a sympy expression to boolean, which can lead to precision loss because:\n1. Sympy expressions may contain complex symbolic terms\n2. Direct boolean conversion doesn't properly handle all edge cases\n3. Important mathematical properties may be lost in conversion\n4. This could lead to incorrect shape calculations or optimizations\n",

    "summary": "\nThe while_loop_func function handles functionalization of while_loop operations in PyTorch. The vulnerable lines check for potential input mutations and aliasing in the condition and body functions of the while loop. This is important because:\n1. While loops must maintain functional purity for correct autograd behavior\n2. Input mutations could lead to incorrect gradients or runtime errors\n3. Aliasing could cause unexpected side effects across iterations\n4. Missing these checks could allow unsafe operations in the loop body\n",

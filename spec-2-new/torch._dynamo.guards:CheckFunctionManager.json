    "summary": "\nThe id_ref function in CheckFunctionManager handles weak reference tracking for objects used in guards. The vulnerable line stores weak references in a dictionary that could grow unbounded if objects are frequently created. This is problematic because:\n1. Weak references are stored indefinitely in self._weakrefs\n2. No cleanup mechanism exists for stale entries\n3. High object churn could lead to memory leaks\n4. Missing validation of guard check results could cause silent failures\n",

    "summary": "\nThe id_ref function in CheckFunctionManager handles weak reference tracking for objects used in guards. The vulnerable line stores weak references in a dictionary that could grow unbounded if objects are frequently created. This is important because:\n1. Weak references are used to track object lifetimes\n2. The dictionary is never cleaned up\n3. Frequent object creation could lead to memory leaks\n4. Missing cleanup could impact long-running processes\n```\n\n```python\nclass TestModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.layer = nn.Linear(10, 10)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # This will trigger id_ref calls for each tensor\n        x1 = self.layer(x)\n        x2 = self.layer(x1)\n        x3 = self.layer(x2)\n        return x3\n",

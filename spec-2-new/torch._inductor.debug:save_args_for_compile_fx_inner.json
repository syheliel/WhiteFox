    "summary": "\nThe save_args_for_compile_fx_inner function is used to serialize and save arguments for a compile_fx_inner function call to disk using pickle. The vulnerable line performs unsafe pickle serialization which can lead to:\n1. Arbitrary code execution during deserialization\n2. Security vulnerabilities if untrusted pickle files are loaded\n3. Potential injection attacks if the pickle file is manipulated\n4. No validation of the pickle data before loading\n```\n\n```python\nclass ModelWithPickle(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 10)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # This will trigger save_args_for_compile_fx_inner when compiled\n        x = self.linear(x)\n        x = torch.relu(x)\n        return x\n\n# Example usage that would trigger the vulnerable pickle dump\nmodel = ModelWithPickle()\ninput = torch.randn(1, 10)\ncompiled_model = torch.compile(model)\noutput = compiled_model(input)\n",

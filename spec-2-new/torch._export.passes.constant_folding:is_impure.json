    "summary": "\nThe is_impure function in ConstantFolder class checks if a node operation should be considered impure (not safe to constant fold). The vulnerable line specifically checks if a node converting element types has an int8 input and converts to bfloat16. This check is problematic because:\n1. It hardcodes int8 dtype check while ignoring other integer types\n2. Similar precision issues could occur with other integer types (int16, int32 etc)\n3. The check assumes only int8->bfloat16 conversion needs special handling\n4. Missing validation for other integer types could lead to incorrect constant folding\n",

    "summary": "\nThe to_torch_tensor and to_tvm_tensor functions handle tensor conversion between TVM and PyTorch formats. The vulnerable lines deal with boolean tensor conversion through numpy as a fallback when direct DLPack conversion isn't available. This is problematic because:\n1. DLPack doesn't support boolean tensors natively\n2. The numpy conversion path introduces additional data copy overhead\n3. Potential precision loss during the conversion process\n4. No direct boolean tensor support in the conversion pipeline\n",

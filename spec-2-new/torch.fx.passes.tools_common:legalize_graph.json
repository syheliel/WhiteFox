    "summary": "\nThe legalize_graph function is responsible for topologically sorting nodes in a GraphModule to ensure proper execution order. The vulnerable aspects are:\n1. Input validation: The function doesn't validate the input GraphModule parameter, which could lead to issues if invalid input is provided\n2. Operator coverage: The hardcoded PRIORITIZED_OPS list may not include all quantization-sensitive operations, potentially causing incorrect execution order for quantization-related operations\n```\n\n```python\nclass UnsortedModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(10, 10)\n        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(10, 10)\n        self.relu = nn.ReLU()\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Create intentionally unsorted operations\n        x = self.linear1(x)\n        x = self.relu(x)\n        x = self.linear2(x)\n        x = x + torch.ones_like(x)  # Addition operation that should be prioritized\n        x = x * 0.5  # Multiplication that should be prioritized\n        return x\n\n# This will trigger the legalize_graph function when traced\nmodel = UnsortedModel()\ntraced = torch.fx.symbolic_trace(model)\nlegalized = torch.fx.experimental.optimization.legalize_graph(traced)\n",

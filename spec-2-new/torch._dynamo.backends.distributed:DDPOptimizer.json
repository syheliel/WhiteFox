The vulnerable line performs this conversion which could lead to:\n1. Precision loss when converting between real and fake tensor representations\n2. Potential numerical stability issues during distributed training\n3. Inconsistencies between training and inference modes\n4. Problems with gradient computation during backpropagation\n",

    "summary": "\nThe functionalize_rng_ops flag controls whether PyTorch's random number generator (RNG) operations are converted to their functional equivalents. The vulnerability lies in:\n1. Only CUDA RNG ops are functionalized while other RNG ops remain unchanged\n2. This inconsistency can lead to precision issues when mixing functional and non-functional RNG ops\n3. The flag being False by default means users might not be aware of potential precision discrepancies\n4. Missing functionalization for non-CUDA RNG ops could affect reproducibility\n",

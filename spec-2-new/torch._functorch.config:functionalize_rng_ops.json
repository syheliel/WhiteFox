    "summary": "\nThe functionalize_rng_ops flag controls whether PyTorch converts random number generator (RNG) operations to their functional equivalents. The vulnerability lies in:\n1. Only CUDA RNG ops are functionalized while others are ignored\n2. This can lead to precision inconsistencies between different RNG operations\n3. Non-CUDA RNG ops may behave differently in functional vs non-functional modes\n4. The flag being False by default means these precision issues may go unnoticed\n```\n\n```python\nclass RNGModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(p=0.5)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # This will use different RNG behavior depending on functionalize_rng_ops\n        x = self.dropout(x)\n        # CPU RNG operation that won't be functionalized\n        x = torch.rand_like(x) * x\n        return x\n",

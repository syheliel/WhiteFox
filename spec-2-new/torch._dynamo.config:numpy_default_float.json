    "summary": "\nThe numpy_default_float configuration setting determines the default floating point precision used when tracing NumPy operations in PyTorch. The vulnerable line sets this default to \"float64\" which:\n1. Uses more memory than necessary for many machine learning applications\n2. May cause performance overhead when float32 precision would be sufficient\n3. Could lead to unnecessary memory usage in models processing large tensors\n4. Should typically be set to \"float32\" for most deep learning use cases\n",

    "summary": "\nThe transpose_matmul function performs matrix multiplication with optional transposes on input tensors. The vulnerable line handles the actual matrix multiplication operation. Potential numerical precision issues can occur because:\n1. Matrix multiplication with transposed inputs can amplify floating-point errors\n2. The operation doesn't include any numerical stability checks\n3. Different transpose combinations may produce varying precision results\n4. No input validation is performed on matrix shapes or values\n",

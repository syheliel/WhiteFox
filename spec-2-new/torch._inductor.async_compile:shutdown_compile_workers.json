    "summary": "\nThe shutdown_compile_workers function is responsible for shutting down all compile worker pools when the program exits. The vulnerable line iterates through all pools in _pool_set and calls shutdown() on each one. The lack of error handling is problematic because:\n1. Pool shutdown failures could leave resources dangling\n2. Exceptions during shutdown could prevent other pools from being properly closed\n3. No logging or reporting of shutdown failures\n4. Could lead to resource leaks or unstable program state during exit\n```\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass ModelWithCompile(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, 3)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        return self.conv(x)\n\nmodel = ModelWithCompile()\noptimized_model = torch.compile(model)\ninput = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32)\noutput = optimized_model(input)  # This will trigger compile workers\n```\n\n```yaml\n- torch.compile\n- nn.Conv2d\n",

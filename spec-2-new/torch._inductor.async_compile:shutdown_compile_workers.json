    "summary": "\nThe shutdown_compile_workers function is responsible for shutting down all outstanding compile-worker pools in PyTorch's async compilation system. The vulnerable line iterates through all pools in _pool_set and calls shutdown() on each one. The lack of error handling is problematic because:\n1. Pool shutdown operations can fail in various ways\n2. Failed shutdowns could leave resources in an inconsistent state\n3. There's no logging or recovery mechanism for shutdown failures\n4. Subsequent operations might assume pools are properly terminated\n```\n\n```python\nclass TestModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(3, 64, kernel_size=3)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # This will trigger async compilation which uses the worker pools\n        x = self.conv(x)\n        x = torch.nn.functional.gelu(x)\n        x = torch.nn.functional.layer_norm(x, x.shape[-1:])\n        return x\n\n# The vulnerability would be triggered when the program exits\n# and the atexit handler calls shutdown_compile_workers()\n",

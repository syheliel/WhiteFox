The vulnerable line iterates through all pools in _pool_set and calls shutdown() on each one. The lack of error handling is problematic because:\n1. Pool shutdown operations can fail in various ways\n2. Failed shutdowns could leave resources dangling\n3. Subsequent operations might assume pools are properly shut down\n4. No feedback is provided about shutdown failures\n",

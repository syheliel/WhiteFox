    "summary": "\nThe `_aot_export_function` handles exporting PyTorch functions to FX graphs. The vulnerable line checks if `no_tangents` is True when `trace_joint` is True, but misses validation for cases where `no_tangents` is True in non-joint scenarios. This is important because:\n1. `no_tangents` should only be used with joint graphs\n2. Using `no_tangents` without `trace_joint` could lead to incorrect graph exports\n3. Missing validation could cause silent errors in non-joint cases\n4. The flag's behavior is only well-defined for joint graphs\n",

    "summary": "\nThe decompose_auto_functionalized function handles decomposition of auto_functionalized nodes in PyTorch graphs. The vulnerable line replaces auto_functionalized nodes with their decomposed form (clones + mutation ops). This is important because:\n1. It helps optimize graphs by breaking down higher-order ops\n2. It ensures proper handling of tensor mutations\n3. It maintains correctness by preserving cloning behavior\n4. Missing validation could lead to incorrect graph transformations\n",

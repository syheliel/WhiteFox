    "summary": "\nThe decompose_auto_functionalized function handles the decomposition of auto_functionalized nodes in PyTorch graphs. The vulnerable line replaces auto_functionalized nodes with their decomposed form (clones + mutation operations). This is important because:\n1. Auto_functionalized nodes represent operations that need functionalization\n2. The decomposition process must preserve correctness while enabling optimizations\n3. Improper decomposition could lead to incorrect mutations or memory issues\n4. The replacement must maintain proper tensor aliasing relationships\n```\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass ModelWithFunctionalizedOp(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(3, 3))\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # This would get auto_functionalized during tracing\n        x = x + self.weight\n        x[0,0] = 1.0  # In-place operation\n        return x\n\nmodel = ModelWithFunctionalizedOp()\ntraced = torch.fx.symbolic_trace(model)\n# The traced graph would contain auto_functionalized nodes\n# that would be processed by decompose_auto_functionalized\n```\n\n```yaml\n- nn.Module\n- nn.Parameter\n- torch.fx.symbolic_trace\n",

    "summary": "\nThe decompose_auto_functionalized function handles decomposition of auto_functionalized nodes in PyTorch graphs. The vulnerable line replaces matched patterns with decomposed versions while skipping functional passes. This is important because:\n1. It processes auto_functionalized operations that involve cloning and mutation\n2. The replacement preserves the original computation while changing implementation\n3. Skipping functional passes could bypass important safety checks\n4. Incorrect decomposition could lead to wrong results or memory issues\n```\n\n```python\nclass AutoFunctionalModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(10, 10))\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # This would trigger auto_functionalized internally\n        y = x + 1\n        y.add_(self.weight)  # In-place operation\n        return y * 0.5\n",

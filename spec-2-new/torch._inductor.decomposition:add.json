    "summary": "\nThe `add` function handles element-wise addition of two tensors with special handling for complex tensors. The vulnerable line checks that both input tensors are complex tensors before proceeding with the operation. This strict requirement is important because:\n1. Complex number operations require special handling\n2. The function includes special broadcasting logic for complex tensors\n3. Incorrect type handling could lead to mathematical errors\n4. The decomposition assumes both inputs are complex tensors\n",

    "summary": "\nThe `add` function handles element-wise addition of two tensors with special handling for complex tensors. The vulnerable line checks that both input tensors are complex tensors before proceeding with the operation. This strict requirement may be problematic because:\n1. It prevents mixed-type operations between complex and real tensors\n2. It may unnecessarily restrict valid use cases\n3. The error handling could be more graceful\n4. The function could potentially handle real tensors as a special case of complex tensors\n```\n\n```python\nclass ComplexModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(3, 3, dtype=torch.complex64))\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # This will trigger the type check since x is real but weight is complex\n        out = x + self.weight\n        return out\n",

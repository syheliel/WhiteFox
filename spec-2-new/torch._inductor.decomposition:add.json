    "summary": "\nThe `add` function in PyTorch's decomposition module handles complex tensor addition with strict type checking. The vulnerable line enforces that both input tensors must be complex, which may be overly restrictive for some use cases. This strict requirement:\n1. Forces both inputs to be complex tensors\n2. Rejects valid operations where one input could be real\n3. May unnecessarily limit mixed-type operations\n4. Could be relaxed while maintaining mathematical correctness\n```\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\n# Example that would trigger the strict complex check\nx = torch.randn(3, 3, dtype=torch.complex64)\ny = torch.randn(3, 3)  # Real tensor\ntry:\n    z = x + y  # Would fail the complex tensor check\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n```\n\n```yaml\n- torch.add\n- torch.Tensor.add_\n- torch.Tensor.__add__\n- torch.Tensor.__radd__\n- torch.complex\n- torch.view_as_complex\n",

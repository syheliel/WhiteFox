    "summary": "\nThe folded_op function handles binary operation folding optimization in PyTorch graphs. The vulnerable lines erase nodes after folding operations, which is critical because:\n1. It removes original binary operation nodes after fusing them with computation nodes\n2. It removes original computation nodes after creating fused versions\n3. Missing proper validation before erasure could lead to graph corruption\n4. The erasure assumes nodes are no longer needed after fusion\n```\n\n```python\nclass MixedPrecisionModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3)\n        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(16, 16))\n        self.bias = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(16))\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # This will trigger binary folding optimization\n        conv_out = self.conv(x)\n        linear_out = torch.addmm(self.bias, conv_out, self.weight)\n        scaled_out = linear_out * 0.5  # Binary operation that will be folded\n        return scaled_out\n",

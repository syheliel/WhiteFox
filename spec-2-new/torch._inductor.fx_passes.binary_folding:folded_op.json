    "summary": "\nThe folded_op function handles binary operation folding optimization in PyTorch graphs. The vulnerable lines erase nodes after folding binary operations with computation nodes (convolution/mm/addmm). This is important because:\n1. It performs graph transformations by fusing binary ops with computation ops\n2. The node erasure removes original operations after fusion\n3. Missing validation could lead to incorrect graph transformations\n4. The fusion assumes proper node relationships before erasure\n",

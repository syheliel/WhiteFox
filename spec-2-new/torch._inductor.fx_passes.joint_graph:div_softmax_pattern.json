    "summary": "\nThe div_softmax_pattern function handles a common pattern in softmax computations where division is used for scaling. The vulnerable line performs the final scaled subtraction and division operation that can lead to numerical stability issues because:\n1. Division by small values can cause overflow\n2. The sign multiplication could amplify numerical errors\n3. The operation combines multiple potentially unstable operations\n4. No safeguards against division by zero or near-zero values\n```\n\n```python\nclass SoftmaxModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 10)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Create a pattern that will trigger div_softmax_pattern\n        x = self.linear(x)\n        scaled = x / 0.1  # Small divisor that could cause numerical instability\n        max_val = torch.amax(scaled, dim=1, keepdim=True)\n        output = scaled - max_val  # This will be transformed to the vulnerable pattern\n        return output\n",

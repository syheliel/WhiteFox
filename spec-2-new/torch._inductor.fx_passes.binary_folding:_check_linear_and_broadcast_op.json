    "summary": "\nThe _check_linear_and_broadcast_op function validates whether binary operations can be safely folded into linear operations (addmm/mm) in PyTorch graphs. The vulnerable lines handle:\n1. Argument checking for bias nodes in linear operations, which may be incomplete\n2. Type promotion checks between weights and other tensors, which could lead to precision loss\nThe function ensures binary operations can be fused with linear operations while maintaining numerical correctness and performance.\n",

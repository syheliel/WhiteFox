    "summary": "\nThe optimize_for_inference function performs several optimization passes for inference purposes, including Conv/BN fusion, dropout removal, and MKL layout optimizations. The vulnerable lines relate to:\n1. Incomplete validation of the pass_config dictionary which could lead to runtime errors if invalid configurations are provided\n2. Hardcoded float32 requirement that may cause precision issues with other data types\n3. Assumptions about CPU-only and float-only operations that aren't properly validated\n",

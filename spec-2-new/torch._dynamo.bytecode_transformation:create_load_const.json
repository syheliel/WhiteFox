    "summary": "\nThe create_load_const function creates a LOAD_CONST instruction for loading a constant value onto the stack. The vulnerable line checks if the constant is safe using is_safe_constant() before creating the instruction. This is important because:\n1. Loading unsafe constants could lead to security vulnerabilities\n2. The check prevents loading of potentially dangerous objects\n3. Missing validation could allow malicious constants to be loaded\n4. The assertion provides a safety net for constant loading operations\n",

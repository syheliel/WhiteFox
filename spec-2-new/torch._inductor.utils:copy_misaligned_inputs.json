    "summary": "\nThe copy_misaligned_inputs function handles copying misaligned tensor inputs to ensure proper memory alignment. The vulnerable line checks that the input is a torch.Tensor before copying. This is important because:\n1. The function assumes tensor operations like data_ptr() and clone_preserve_strides()\n2. Other input types (int, SymInt) would cause runtime errors\n3. Missing validation could lead to crashes if non-tensor inputs are passed\n4. The function is used in critical paths for memory optimization\n",

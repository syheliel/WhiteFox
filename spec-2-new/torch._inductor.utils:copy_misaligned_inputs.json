    "summary": "\nThe copy_misaligned_inputs function handles copying tensor inputs that are not properly memory aligned. The vulnerable line checks that the input is a torch.Tensor before attempting to copy it. This is important because:\n1. The function assumes all inputs are tensors for memory alignment operations\n2. Other input types (like integers or None) would cause runtime errors\n3. Missing type validation could lead to crashes with non-tensor inputs\n4. The function is used in critical path for input processing in Inductor\n```\n\n```python\nclass MisalignedModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # This could trigger the vulnerable line if x is not a tensor\n        x = self.conv(x)\n        return x * 2\n\n# Example usage that could trigger the assert:\nmodel = MisalignedModel()\ninput_data = 5  # Not a tensor\noutput = model(input_data)  # Would fail at copy_misaligned_inputs\n",

    "summary": "\nThe map_functionalize function handles functional transformations for the map higher-order operation in PyTorch. The vulnerable line checks for potential input mutations during the map operation, which is important because:\n1. Functional transformations require pure functions without side effects\n2. Input mutations would violate functional programming principles\n3. The check prevents incorrect behavior in autograd and compilation\n4. The current error message could be more specific about which input was mutated\n```\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\ndef f(x):\n    x.mul_(2)  # This will mutate the input\n    return x\n\nxs = torch.randn(2, 3)\ntry:\n    result = torch._higher_order_ops.map(f, xs)\nexcept RuntimeError as e:\n    print(\"Caught mutation error:\", e)\n```\n\n```yaml\n- torch._higher_order_ops.map\n- torch.Tensor.mul_\n",

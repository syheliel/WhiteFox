    "summary": "\nThe map_functionalize function handles functionalization of the map operation in PyTorch. The vulnerable line checks for potential input mutations during the map operation, which is important because:\n1. Functional transformations require pure functions without side effects\n2. Input mutations would violate the functional programming paradigm\n3. The error message could be more specific about which input was mutated\n4. Missing proper mutation detection could lead to incorrect results in functional contexts\n",

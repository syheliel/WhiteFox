    "summary": "\nThe map_functionalize function handles functionalization of map operations in PyTorch. The vulnerable line checks for potential input mutations during the map operation. This is important because:\n1. Functionalization requires pure functions without side effects\n2. Input mutations would violate functional programming principles\n3. The error message could be more specific about which input was mutated\n4. Missing proper mutation detection could lead to incorrect functionalized results\n```\n\n```python\nclass MapModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(3, 3))\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # This will trigger the mutation check when used with map\n        def map_fn(xi):\n            xi.mul_(2)  # In-place operation that mutates input\n            return xi @ self.weight\n            \n        # Using map with mutating function\n        try:\n            return torch.utils._map_impl.map(map_fn, x)\n        except RuntimeError as e:\n            print(\"Caught mutation error:\", e)\n            return x\n",

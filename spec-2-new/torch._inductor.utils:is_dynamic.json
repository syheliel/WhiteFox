    "summary": "\nThe is_dynamic function checks if tensor inputs have dynamic shapes or strides by examining their size and stride properties. The vulnerable line performs type checking for various tensor representations but may miss other possible input types that could also have dynamic properties. This is important because:\n1. The function is used to determine if optimizations can be applied\n2. Missing type checks could lead to incorrect dynamic shape detection\n3. Different tensor representations may have dynamic properties\n4. Complete type coverage ensures accurate dynamic shape analysis\n```\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass DynamicShapeModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 10)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # This could trigger dynamic shape analysis\n        if x.size(0) > 5:\n            return self.linear(x[:5])\n        return self.linear(x)\n\nmodel = DynamicShapeModel()\nx = torch.randn(10, 10)\noutput = model(x)  # This would be analyzed by is_dynamic\n```\n\n```yaml\n- nn.Linear\n- torch.Tensor.size\n- torch.Tensor.stride\n",

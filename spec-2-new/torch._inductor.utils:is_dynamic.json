    "summary": "\nThe is_dynamic function checks if a tensor has dynamic shapes by examining its size and stride properties. The vulnerable line performs type checking on various tensor representations but may miss other possible input types that could also have dynamic shapes. This is important because:\n1. The function is used to determine if a tensor's dimensions can vary at runtime\n2. Missing type checks could lead to incorrect dynamic shape detection\n3. Dynamic shape handling affects code generation and optimization decisions\n4. Incomplete type coverage might cause runtime errors for valid tensor types\n",

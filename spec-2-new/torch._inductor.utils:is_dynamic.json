    "summary": "\nThe is_dynamic function checks if any input tensor has dynamic shapes by examining their size and stride information. The vulnerable line performs type checking for various tensor types but may miss other possible input types that could also have dynamic shapes. This is important because:\n1. Dynamic shapes require special handling in codegen\n2. Missing type checks could lead to incorrect assumptions about tensor shapes\n3. All tensor-like inputs should be checked for dynamic dimensions\n4. The function is used to determine if optimizations can be applied\n```\n\n```python\nclass DynamicShapeModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Create tensor with potentially dynamic shape\n        t1 = self.conv(x)\n        # Create view with dynamic stride\n        t2 = t1[:, :, ::2, ::2]\n        return t2\n",

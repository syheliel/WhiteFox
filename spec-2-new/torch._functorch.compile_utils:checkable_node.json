    "summary": "\nThe checkable_node function is used to determine if a node in an FX graph represents a tensor with defined storage that can be evaluated. The vulnerable line checks if the node's meta data contains a \"val\" key and if that value is a torch.Tensor, but lacks proper validation of the node input type before accessing the meta data. This is important because:\n1. FX nodes may not always have meta data\n2. Improper node types could cause crashes when accessing meta data\n3. Missing validation could lead to runtime errors\n4. The function assumes the node has properly formatted meta data\n```\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.fx as fx\n\nclass SimpleModel(torch.nn.Module):\n    def forward(self, x):\n        return x * 2\n\nmodel = SimpleModel()\ntraced = fx.symbolic_trace(model)\nnode = list(traced.graph.nodes)[1]  # Get the mul operation node\n\n# This would trigger the vulnerable line when checking if the node is checkable\nnode.meta[\"val\"] = torch.randn(3)  # Set tensor value in meta\n```\n\n```yaml\n- fx.symbolic_trace\n- fx.Graph\n- fx.Node\n",

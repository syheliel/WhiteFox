The vulnerable line performs a direct integer conversion which may lose precision when:\n1. The input expression is a large integer that exceeds Python's int precision\n2. The symbolic expression contains floating point components\n3. The conversion truncates decimal values\n4. The input is a complex expression that should be evaluated symbolically first\n",

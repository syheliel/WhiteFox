    "summary": "\nThe fake_tensor_cache_enabled configuration controls whether fake tensor dispatches are cached during compilation. This is important because:\n1. Fake tensors are used during tracing/compilation to simulate real tensors\n2. Caching dispatches can improve performance by avoiding redundant work\n3. However, if tensor properties change between calls, caching could lead to incorrect behavior\n4. The default is enabled (\"1\") but can be disabled via environment variable\n```\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass ModelWithChangingTensor(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(3, 3))\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Changing tensor properties between calls\n        if x.sum() > 0:\n            self.weight.data += 0.1\n        return x @ self.weight\n\nmodel = ModelWithChangingTensor()\ncompiled_model = torch.compile(model)\nx = torch.randn(3, 3)\ncompiled_model(x)  # First call\ncompiled_model(-x) # Second call with different path\n```\n\n```yaml\n- torch.compile\n- nn.Parameter\n- torch.randn\n",

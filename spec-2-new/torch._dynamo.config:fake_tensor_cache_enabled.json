    "summary": "\nThe fake_tensor_cache_enabled configuration controls whether fake tensor dispatches are cached during compilation. This is important because:\n1. Fake tensors are used during tracing to simulate real tensors\n2. Caching dispatches can improve performance by avoiding redundant work\n3. However, if tensor properties change between calls, caching could lead to incorrect behavior\n4. The default is enabled (\"1\") but can be disabled via environment variable\n```\n\n```python\nclass ModelWithChangingTensor(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(3, 3))\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # First use - cached if enabled\n        x = x * self.weight\n        \n        # Modify tensor properties\n        self.weight.data = self.weight.data * 2\n        \n        # Second use - may use cached version incorrectly\n        x = x + self.weight\n        \n        return x\n",

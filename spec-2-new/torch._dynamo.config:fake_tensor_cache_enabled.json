Fake tensors are used during tracing/compilation to represent tensor properties\n2. Caching fake tensor dispatches can improve performance by avoiding recomputation\n3. However, if tensor properties change between calls, caching could lead to incorrect behavior\n4. The default is enabled (True) but can be disabled via environment variable\n",

    "summary": "\nThe BatchLayernormFusion class handles fusing multiple layer normalization operations in PyTorch graphs. The vulnerable line checks that all epsilon values used in the layer norm operations are equal before fusing them. This is important because:\n1. Layer normalization uses epsilon for numerical stability\n2. Different epsilon values would produce mathematically different results\n3. The fusion assumes consistent epsilon values across operations\n4. Missing validation could lead to incorrect fused results if epsilons differ\n",

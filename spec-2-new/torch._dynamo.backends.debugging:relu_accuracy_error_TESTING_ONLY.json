    "summary": "\nThe relu_accuracy_error_TESTING_ONLY function is a debugging backend that intentionally modifies ReLU operations to addition operations to force accuracy errors. This is used for:\n1. Testing error handling and debugging capabilities\n2. Simulating accuracy issues in model outputs\n3. Validating error detection mechanisms\n4. Creating controlled test cases for debugging tools\nThe vulnerable line directly modifies the graph by replacing ReLU operations with additions, which would produce mathematically different results.\n```\n\n```python\nclass TestModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.conv(x)\n        x = torch.relu(x)  # This will be replaced with torch.add(x, 1)\n        x = torch.max_pool2d(x, 2)\n        return x\n",

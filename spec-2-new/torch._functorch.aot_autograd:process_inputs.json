    "summary": "\nThe `process_inputs` function handles converting real tensors into fake tensors for tracing in PyTorch. The vulnerable line creates fake tensors with dynamic shapes (static_shapes=False), which can lead to precision issues because:\n1. Dynamic shapes may cause numerical instability during tracing\n2. Shape-dependent operations may produce different results with dynamic vs static shapes\n3. The fake tensor system assumes consistent shapes for accurate tracing\n4. Precision errors could propagate through subsequent operations\n```\n\n```python\nclass DynamicShapeModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 10)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # This operation's precision may vary with dynamic shapes\n        x = self.linear(x)\n        # Shape-dependent operation that could be affected\n        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)\n        return x\n",

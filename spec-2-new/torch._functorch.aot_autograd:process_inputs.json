The vulnerable line creates fake tensors with dynamic shapes (static_shapes=False), which can lead to precision issues when:\n1. The tensor shape changes during execution\n2. Shape-dependent operations are performed\n3. Numerical stability is affected by shape variations\n4. Backward pass computations are shape-sensitive\n",

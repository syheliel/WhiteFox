Using a generic Exception for invalid fuser names which could mask other exceptions\n2. Potential undefined variable access when restoring profiling executor state\n3. Critical state management of JIT compilation and fusion settings\n4. Affects performance optimization paths in PyTorch's JIT compilation\n",

    "summary": "\nThe PostGradBatchLinearFusion class handles fusing multiple linear operations in PyTorch graphs during post-grad optimization. The vulnerable line performs batch matrix multiplication (bmm) fusion which could lead to precision loss when combining multiple linear operations. This is important because:\n1. bmm operations may have different numerical properties than individual linear ops\n2. The fusion assumes input tensors are 2D without proper type validation\n3. Missing input checks could lead to incorrect fused results or errors\n4. Precision differences may affect model accuracy\n",

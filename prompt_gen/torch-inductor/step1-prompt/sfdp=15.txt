### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs that meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = t1 * 0.5 # Multiply the output of the convolution by 0.5
t3 = t1 * 0.7071067811865476 # Multiply the output of the convolution by 0.7071067811865476
t4 = torch.erf(t3) # Apply the error function to the output of the convolution
t5 = t4 + 1 # Add 1 to the output of the error function
t6 = t2 * t5 # Multiply the output of the convolution by the output of the error function
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise convolution is multiplied by a constant `0.5`, and then the output of the convolution is multiplied by another constant `0.7071067811865476`, and then the error function is applied to the output of the convolution, and then `1` is added to the output of the error function, and then the output of the convolution is multiplied by the output of the error function.

# Model
class Model(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv = torch.nn.Conv2d(3, 8, 1, stride=1, padding=1)
 
    def forward(self, x1):
        v1 = self.conv(x1)
        v2 = v1 * 0.5
        v3 = v1 * 0.7071067811865476
        v4 = torch.erf(v3)
        v5 = v4 + 1
        v6 = v2 * v5
        return v6

### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs that meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model. The model should be different from the previous one.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
q = query.permute([0, 2, 1, 3]) # Permute the dimensions of the query tensor
k = key.permute([0, 2, 1, 3]) # Permute the dimensions of the key tensor
v = value.permute([0, 2, 1, 3]) # Permute the dimensions of the value tensor
attn_weights = (torch.matmul(q, k.transpose(-2, -1)).div(inv_scale) + attn_mask).softmax(dim=-1) # Compute the attention weights
dropout_attn_weights = torch.nn.functional.dropout(attn_weights, dropout_p) # Apply dropout to the attention weights
output = dropout_attn_weights.matmul(v) # Multiply the dropout attention weights by the value tensor
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the dimensions of the query, key, and value tensors are permuted, then the attention weights are computed by taking the dot product of the query and key tensors, scaling the result by the inverse scale, adding an attention mask, and applying a softmax function. Dropout is then applied to the attention weights, and the result is multiplied by the value tensor. This is a typical pattern found in self-attention mechanisms, such as those used in Transformer models.

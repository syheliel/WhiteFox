### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs that meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = t1 * 0.5 # Multiply the output of the convolution by 0.5
t3 = t1 * 0.7071067811865476 # Multiply the output of the convolution by 0.7071067811865476
t4 = torch.erf(t3) # Apply the error function to the output of the convolution
t5 = t4 + 1 # Add 1 to the output of the error function
t6 = t2 * t5 # Multiply the output of the convolution by the output of the error function
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise convolution is multiplied by a constant `0.5`, and then the output of the convolution is multiplied by another constant `0.7071067811865476`, and then the error function is applied to the output of the convolution, and then `1` is added to the output of the error function, and then the output of the convolution is multiplied by the output of the error function.

class Model(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv = torch.nn.Conv2d(3, 8, 1, stride=1, padding=1)
 
    def forward(self, x1):
        v1 = self.conv(x1)
        v2 = v1 * 0.5
        v3 = v1 * 0.7071067811865476
        v4 = torch.erf(v3)
        v5 = v4 + 1
        v6 = v2 * v5
        return v6

### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs that meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model. The model should be different from the previous one.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
q = query.permute(0, 2, 1, 3) # Permute the dimensions of the query tensor
k = key.permute(0, 2, 1, 3) # Permute the dimensions of the key tensor
v = value.permute(0, 2, 1, 3) # Permute the dimensions of the value tensor
attention = torch.matmul(q, k.transpose(-2, -1)) # Compute the dot product of the query and the transposed key
scaled_attention = attention.div(inv_scale) # Scale the attention scores by the inverse scale
attention_weights = scaled_attention.softmax(dim=-1) # Apply softmax to the scaled attention scores
output = attention_weights.matmul(v) # Compute the weighted sum of the value tensor
```
This pattern characterizes the scaled dot-product attention mechanism used in Transformer models. The query, key, and value tensors are first permuted. Then, the dot product of the query and the transposed key is computed to obtain the attention scores. These scores are then scaled by an inverse scale factor and passed through a softmax function to obtain the attention weights. Finally, the weighted sum of the value tensor is computed to obtain the output.

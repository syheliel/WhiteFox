### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs that meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = t1 * 0.5 # Multiply the output of the convolution by 0.5
t3 = t1 * 0.7071067811865476 # Multiply the output of the convolution by 0.7071067811865476
t4 = torch.erf(t3) # Apply the error function to the output of the convolution
t5 = t4 + 1 # Add 1 to the output of the error function
t6 = t2 * t5 # Multiply the output of the convolution by the output of the error function
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise convolution is multiplied by a constant `0.5`, and then the output of the convolution is multiplied by another constant `0.7071067811865476`, and then the error function is applied to the output of the convolution, and then `1` is added to the output of the error function, and then the output of the convolution is multiplied by the output of the error function.

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv = torch.nn.Conv2d(3, 8, 1, stride=1, padding=1)
 
    def forward(self, x1):
        v1 = self.conv(x1)
        v2 = v1 * 0.5
        v3 = v1 * 0.7071067811865476
        v4 = torch.erf(v3)
        v5 = v4 + 1
        v6 = v2 * v5
        return v6

### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs that meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model. The model should be different from the previous one.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
output = torch.addmm(input, mat1, mat2)
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the `addmm` function is used, which performs a matrix multiplication of `mat1` and `mat2` and adds the result to `input`.

In order for the `should_decompose_mm` function to return `True`, the model must meet the following conditions:

1. The `decompose_mem_bound_mm` configuration in `torch._inductor.config` is set to `True`.
2. The `mat1` and `mat2` tensors are on the same device.
3. None of the tensors `mat1`, `mat2`, and `input` are symbolic tensors.
4. Both `mat1` and `mat2` are 2D tensors.
5. The first dimension of `mat1` is greater than or equal to `10240`.
6. Both dimensions of `mat2` are less than `32`.

These conditions suggest that the model is designed to handle large-scale matrix multiplication operations, and the `should_decompose_mm` function is used to determine whether these operations should be decomposed for memory efficiency.

### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs that meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = t1 * 0.5 # Multiply the output of the convolution by 0.5
t3 = t1 * 0.7071067811865476 # Multiply the output of the convolution by 0.7071067811865476
t4 = torch.erf(t3) # Apply the error function to the output of the convolution
t5 = t4 + 1 # Add 1 to the output of the error function
t6 = t2 * t5 # Multiply the output of the convolution by the output of the error function
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise convolution is multiplied by a constant `0.5`, and then the output of the convolution is multiplied by another constant `0.7071067811865476`, and then the error function is applied to the output of the convolution, and then `1` is added to the output of the error function, and then the output of the convolution is multiplied by the output of the error function.

# Model
class Model(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv = torch.nn.Conv2d(3, 8, 1, stride=1, padding=1)
 
    def forward(self, x1):
        v1 = self.conv(x1)
        v2 = v1 * 0.5
        v3 = v1 * 0.7071067811865476
        v4 = torch.erf(v3)
        v5 = v4 + 1
        v6 = v2 * v5
        return v6

### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs that meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model. The model should be different from the previous one.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
output = torch.bmm(input1, input2)
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where a batch matrix multiplication (`bmm`) operation is performed on two input tensors.

In addition, for the model to reach the `return True` line in the `should_decompose_bmm` function, the following conditions must be met:

1. The `decompose_mem_bound_mm` configuration in `torch._inductor.config` must be set to `True`.
2. Both input tensors to the `bmm` operation must be on the same device.
3. None of the input tensors to the `bmm` operation can be symbolic.
4. Both input tensors to the `bmm` operation must be 3-dimensional.
5. The first dimension of the first input tensor to the `bmm` operation must be greater than or equal to `MIN_FIRST_DIMENSION_DECOMPOSITION` (10240).
6. At least two of the following three dimensions must be less than or equal to `MAX_OTHER_DIMENSION_DECOMPOSITION` (32):
   - The second dimension of the first input tensor to the `bmm` operation.
   - The third dimension of the first input tensor to the `bmm` operation.
   - The third dimension of the second input tensor to the `bmm` operation.

### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs that meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = t1 * 0.5 # Multiply the output of the convolution by 0.5
t3 = t1 * 0.7071067811865476 # Multiply the output of the convolution by 0.7071067811865476
t4 = torch.erf(t3) # Apply the error function to the output of the convolution
t5 = t4 + 1 # Add 1 to the output of the error function
t6 = t2 * t5 # Multiply the output of the convolution by the output of the error function
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise convolution is multiplied by a constant `0.5`, and then the output of the convolution is multiplied by another constant `0.7071067811865476`, and then the error function is applied to the output of the convolution, and then `1` is added to the output of the error function, and then the output of the convolution is multiplied by the output of the error function.

# Model
class Model(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv = torch.nn.Conv2d(3, 8, 1, stride=1, padding=1)
 
    def forward(self, x1):
        v1 = self.conv(x1)
        v2 = v1 * 0.5
        v3 = v1 * 0.7071067811865476
        v4 = torch.erf(v3)
        v5 = v4 + 1
        v6 = v2 * v5
        return v6

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
x1 = torch.randn(1, 3, 64, 64)
__output__ = m(x1)

### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs that meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model. The model should be different from the previous one.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain the following pattern:

```
split_tensors = torch.split(input_tensor, split_sections) # Split the input tensor into chunks
selected_tensors = [split_tensors[i] for i in indices] # Select some chunks
output_tensor = torch.cat(selected_tensors, dim) # Concatenate the selected chunks along a specified dimension
```
or
```
split_tensors = torch.split(input_tensor, split_sections) # Split the input tensor into chunks
selected_tensors = [split_tensors[i] for i in indices] # Select some chunks
output_tensor = torch.stack(selected_tensors, dim) # Stack the selected chunks along a specified dimension
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where the input tensor is split into chunks, some chunks are selected, and then the selected chunks are concatenated or stacked along a specified dimension.

The `simplify_split_cat` function is triggered when the split sections are a list or a tuple. If the split sections are not a list or a tuple, the function returns without triggering the optimization.

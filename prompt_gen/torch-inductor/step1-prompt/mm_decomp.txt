### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs that meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = t1 * 0.5 # Multiply the output of the convolution by 0.5
t3 = t1 * 0.7071067811865476 # Multiply the output of the convolution by 0.7071067811865476
t4 = torch.erf(t3) # Apply the error function to the output of the convolution
t5 = t4 + 1 # Add 1 to the output of the error function
t6 = t2 * t5 # Multiply the output of the convolution by the output of the error function
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise convolution is multiplied by a constant `0.5`, and then the output of the convolution is multiplied by another constant `0.7071067811865476`, and then the error function is applied to the output of the convolution, and then `1` is added to the output of the error function, and then the output of the convolution is multiplied by the output of the error function.

# Model
class Model(torch.nn.Module):

        self.conv = torch.nn.Conv2d(3, 8, 1, stride=1, padding=1)
 
    def forward(self, x1):
        v1 = self.conv(x1)
        v2 = v1 * 0.5
        v3 = v1 * 0.7071067811865476
        v4 = torch.erf(v3)
        v5 = v4 + 1
        v6 = v2 * v5
        return v6

### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs that meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model. The model should be different from the previous one.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
output = torch.mm(input1, input2)
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where a matrix multiplication operation is performed on two input tensors.

In addition, the model can reach out `return True` line in function `should_decompose_mm` if it satisfies the following conditions:

1. The `decompose_mem_bound_mm` configuration in `torch._inductor.config` is set to `True`.
2. Both input tensors are on the same device.
3. Neither of the input tensors is symbolic.
4. Both input tensors are 2-dimensional.
5. The first dimension of the first input tensor is greater than or equal to `MIN_FIRST_DIMENSION_DECOMPOSITION` (10240).
6. The first and second dimensions of the second input tensor are less than `MAX_OTHER_DIMENSION_DECOMPOSITION` (32).

These conditions suggest that the model is designed to handle large-scale matrix multiplication operations, and it is optimized for memory-bound computations where the size of the first input tensor is significantly larger than the size of the second input tensor.

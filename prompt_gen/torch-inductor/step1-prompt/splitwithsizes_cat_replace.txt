### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs that meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = t1 * 0.5 # Multiply the output of the convolution by 0.5
t3 = t1 * 0.7071067811865476 # Multiply the output of the convolution by 0.7071067811865476
t4 = torch.erf(t3) # Apply the error function to the output of the convolution
t5 = t4 + 1 # Add 1 to the output of the error function
t6 = t2 * t5 # Multiply the output of the convolution by the output of the error function
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise convolution is multiplied by a constant `0.5`, and then the output of the convolution is multiplied by another constant `0.7071067811865476`, and then the error function is applied to the output of the convolution, and then `1` is added to the output of the error function, and then the output of the convolution is multiplied by the output of the error function.

# Model
class Model(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv = torch.nn.Conv2d(3, 8, 1, stride=1, padding=1)
 
    def forward(self, x1):
        v1 = self.conv(x1)
        v2 = v1 * 0.5
        v3 = v1 * 0.7071067811865476
        v4 = torch.erf(v3)
        v5 = v4 + 1
        v6 = v2 * v5
        return v6

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
x1 = torch.randn(1, 3, 64, 64)
__output__ = m(x1)

### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs that meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model. The model should be different from the previous one.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv(input_tensor) # Apply convolution to the input tensor
t2 = t1 op other # Apply a binary operation (add, subtract, multiply, or divide) with the output of the convolution and another tensor or scalar
```
where `op` is one of the binary operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.

The `_is_foldable_pattern` function will return `True` if the following conditions are met:

1. The convolution operation is applied to the input tensor.
2. The convolution operation is followed by a binary operation (add, subtract, multiply, or divide) with another tensor or scalar.
3. The convolution operation's weight and bias are attributes (i.e., they are not computed within the model).
4. The other tensor or scalar in the binary operation is either a scalar or an attribute.
5. The convolution operation's weight is used only once in the model.
6. The convolution operation's weight is a floating-point tensor.
7. If the other tensor in the binary operation is an attribute, it must be a floating-point tensor, and the result of promoting its type with the convolution operation's weight type must be the same as the convolution operation's weight type.
8. The other tensor in the binary operation must not be broadcasted with the convolution operation's weight. This means that the other tensor's shape must either match the convolution operation's weight shape or be broadcastable to it without changing the weight's shape.

### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs that meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = t1 * 0.5 # Multiply the output of the convolution by 0.5
t3 = t1 * 0.7071067811865476 # Multiply the output of the convolution by 0.7071067811865476
t4 = torch.erf(t3) # Apply the error function to the output of the convolution
t5 = t4 + 1 # Add 1 to the output of the error function
t6 = t2 * t5 # Multiply the output of the convolution by the output of the error function
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise convolution is multiplied by a constant `0.5`, and then the output of the convolution is multiplied by another constant `0.7071067811865476`, and then the error function is applied to the output of the convolution, and then `1` is added to the output of the error function, and then the output of the convolution is multiplied by the output of the error function.

# Model
class Model(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv = torch.nn.Conv2d(3, 8, 1, stride=1, padding=1)
 
    def forward(self, x1):
        v1 = self.conv(x1)
        v2 = v1 * 0.5
        v3 = v1 * 0.7071067811865476
        v4 = torch.erf(v3)
        v5 = v4 + 1
        v6 = v2 * v5
        return v6

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
x1 = torch.randn(1, 3, 64, 64)
__output__ = m(x1)

### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs that meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model. The model should be different from the previous one.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
q = query.permute(0, 2, 1, 3) # Permute the dimensions of the query tensor
k = key.permute(0, 2, 1, 3) # Permute the dimensions of the key tensor
v = value.permute(0, 2, 1, 3) # Permute the dimensions of the value tensor
div = q @ k.transpose(-2, -1) / math.sqrt(q.size(-1)) # Compute the dot product of the query and the transposed key, and divide by the square root of the last dimension of the query
div = div.to(torch.float32) # Convert the result to float32
attn_weight = torch.softmax(div, dim=-1) # Apply softmax to the result along the last dimension
attn_weight = torch.dropout(attn_weight, dropout_p, True) # Apply dropout to the result
attn_weight = attn_weight.to(torch.float16) # Convert the result to float16
attn_weight @ v # Compute the dot product of the result and the value
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the query, key, and value tensors are permuted, the dot product of the query and the transposed key is computed and divided by the square root of the last dimension of the query, softmax is applied to the result along the last dimension, dropout is applied to the result, and then the dot product of the result and the value is computed. This is a typical pattern found in the attention mechanism of Transformer models.

### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs that meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = t1 * 0.5 # Multiply the output of the convolution by 0.5
t3 = t1 * 0.7071067811865476 # Multiply the output of the convolution by 0.7071067811865476
t4 = torch.erf(t3) # Apply the error function to the output of the convolution
t5 = t4 + 1 # Add 1 to the output of the error function
t6 = t2 * t5 # Multiply the output of the convolution by the output of the error function
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise convolution is multiplied by a constant `0.5`, and then the output of the convolution is multiplied by another constant `0.7071067811865476`, and then the error function is applied to the output of the convolution, and then `1` is added to the output of the error function, and then the output of the convolution is multiplied by the output of the error function.

# Model
class Model(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv = torch.nn.Conv2d(3, 8, 1, stride=1, padding=1)
 
    def forward(self, x1):
        v1 = self.conv(x1)
        v2 = v1 * 0.5
        v3 = v1 * 0.7071067811865476
        v4 = torch.erf(v3)
        v5 = v4 + 1
        v6 = v2 * v5
        return v6

# Initializing the model

# Inputs to the model
x1 = torch.randn(1, 3, 64, 64)
__output__ = m(x1)

### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs that meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model. The model should be different from the previous one.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
split_tensor = torch.split(input_tensor, split_sizes, dim) # Split the input tensor into chunks along a given dimension
squeezed_tensors = [torch.squeeze(t, dim) for t in split_tensor] # Squeeze each chunk of the split tensor along the same dimension
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the input tensor is split into chunks along a given dimension, and then each chunk of the split tensor is squeezed along the same dimension.

In order for the `optimization()` line in the `merge_split_squeeze` function to be reached, the model must satisfy the following conditions:
1. The `split_sizes` argument to `torch.split` must be a list of integers, all of which are equal to 1. This means that the input tensor is split into chunks of size 1 along the given dimension.
2. The `dim` argument to `torch.split` and `torch.squeeze` must be an integer, not a sequence. This means that the splitting and squeezing operations are performed along a single dimension.
3. All the users of the `torch.split` node in the computation graph must be `torch.squeeze` nodes. This means that each chunk of the split tensor is immediately squeezed along the same dimension.

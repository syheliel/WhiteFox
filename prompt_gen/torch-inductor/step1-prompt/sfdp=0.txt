### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs that meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = t1 * 0.5 # Multiply the output of the convolution by 0.5
t3 = t1 * 0.7071067811865476 # Multiply the output of the convolution by 0.7071067811865476
t4 = torch.erf(t3) # Apply the error function to the output of the convolution
t5 = t4 + 1 # Add 1 to the output of the error function
t6 = t2 * t5 # Multiply the output of the convolution by the output of the error function
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise convolution is multiplied by a constant `0.5`, and then the output of the convolution is multiplied by another constant `0.7071067811865476`, and then the error function is applied to the output of the convolution, and then `1` is added to the output of the error function, and then the output of the convolution is multiplied by the output of the error function.

# Model
class Model(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv = torch.nn.Conv2d(3, 8, 1, stride=1, padding=1)
 
    def forward(self, x1):
        v1 = self.conv(x1)
        v2 = v1 * 0.5
        v3 = v1 * 0.7071067811865476
        v4 = torch.erf(v3)
        v5 = v4 + 1
        v6 = v2 * v5
        return v6

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
x1 = torch.randn(1, 3, 64, 64)
__output__ = m(x1)

### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs that meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model. The model should be different from the previous one.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
qk = torch.matmul(query, key.transpose(-2, -1)) # Compute the dot product of the query and key tensors
scaled_qk = qk / inv_scale # Scale the dot product by the inverse scale factor
attention_weights = scaled_qk.softmax(dim=-1) # Apply softmax to the scaled dot product to get the attention weights
output = attention_weights.matmul(value) # Compute the weighted sum of the value tensor using the attention weights
```
This pattern characterizes the attention mechanism in transformer models, specifically the scaled dot-product attention. The query and key tensors are multiplied together, then scaled by the inverse of the square root of the dimension of the key, then a softmax is applied to obtain the attention weights, and finally these weights are used to compute a weighted sum of the value tensor.

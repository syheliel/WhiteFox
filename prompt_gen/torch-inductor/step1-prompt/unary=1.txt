### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs that meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = t1 * 0.5 # Multiply the output of the convolution by 0.5
t3 = t1 * 0.7071067811865476 # Multiply the output of the convolution by 0.7071067811865476
t4 = torch.erf(t3) # Apply the error function to the output of the convolution
t5 = t4 + 1 # Add 1 to the output of the error function
t6 = t2 * t5 # Multiply the output of the convolution by the output of the error function
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise convolution is multiplied by a constant `0.5`, and then the output of the convolution is multiplied by another constant `0.7071067811865476`, and then the error function is applied to the output of the convolution, and then `1` is added to the output of the error function, and then the output of the convolution is multiplied by the output of the error function.

# Model
class Model(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv = torch.nn.Conv2d(3, 8, 1, stride=1, padding=1)
 
    def forward(self, x1):
        v1 = self.conv(x1)
        v2 = v1 * 0.5
        v3 = v1 * 0.7071067811865476
        v4 = torch.erf(v3)
        v5 = v4 + 1
        v6 = v2 * v5
        return v6

# Initializing the model

# Inputs to the model

__output__ = m(x1)

### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs that meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model. The model should be different from the previous one.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = linear(input_tensor) # Apply linear transformation to the input tensor
t2 = t1 * 0.5 # Multiply the output of the linear transformation by 0.5
t3 = t1 * t1 * t1 # Cube the output of the linear transformation
t4 = t3 * 0.044715 # Multiply the cubed output by 0.044715
t5 = t1 + t4 # Add the output of the linear transformation to the multiplied cubed output
t6 = t5 * 0.7978845608028654 # Multiply the result by 0.7978845608028654
t7 = torch.tanh(t6) # Apply the hyperbolic tangent function to the result
t8 = t7 + 1 # Add 1 to the output of the hyperbolic tangent function
t9 = t2 * t8 # Multiply the output of the linear transformation by the output of the hyperbolic tangent function
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a linear transformation is multiplied by a constant `0.5`, and then the output of the linear transformation is cubed, and then the cubed output is multiplied by another constant `0.044715`, and then the output of the linear transformation is added to the multiplied cubed output, and then the result is multiplied by another constant `0.7978845608028654`, and then the hyperbolic tangent function is applied to the result, and then `1` is added to the output of the hyperbolic tangent function, and then the output of the linear transformation is multiplied by the output of the hyperbolic tangent function.
